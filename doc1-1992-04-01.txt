Life With the Family Enndye
The advent of spring
and check on my
mental progress. I
ask myself am I still
clever after all this
time but find I'm too
weakminded to answer. I want to run
around in the sun
(unfortunately my
knee hurts, damn).
My job is physical labor. Perhaps it's
helped to make my
brain atrophy. I pick
- vho make
me laugh but don't
ever borrow money
they can't eventually pay back. Education, according to a
source close at hand
but I'm not telling, is
excercise for the
brain. Like any other
muscle it must be
taxed, trained,
toughened. Bad
news for me. Oh no.
Knowing some good
student factoring his
polynomials diligently and getting a
hard firm brain
makes a person
think "not for me
though." Though
factoring is a skill
which can never be
applied, it can be
graded I hear and it
makes educators
who already know
how to factor seem
very clever. I myself
love to read but just
for fun. I know when
D.H. Lawrence
writes that he's never heard "such a superfluity of meretricious persiflage"
he's saying "wot piffle" and I feel I know
wot's going on. I never think about my
progress except in
spring when meaningless happiness
infects me. I must
have been too busy
carrying my limp
soggy brain about in
the sunshine (wot a
lot of insects we've
got this year) on a
day in April not factoring anything at all.

AIRHEAD
Killam bashing. I know
many people who only read
Discorder to read "Abat- '
toir." (Personally, I enjoy (
the whole Discorder) Mr.
Killam's column pokes fun
at social proprieties and
forces his audience to look
at the society in which they
live. The people who take
offence to his articles twist
"Abattoir's" meaning so as
to write "holier than thou"
letters to you. I bet Lane
Dunlop and the other com-
plainers are patting themselves on the back thinking "My morals are better
than yours" (Thank you,
Lane and others for reminding me that our society has not grown enough
to accept reality and/or differing opinions).

FLOGGING A DEAD
HORSE
Dear Airhead,
This letter is in response to
the response of the response of Jules Killam's
article "Counter-culture to
sub-culture"(Try to figure
that one out) I know you
guys are probably getting
bored of receiving so many
letters on one article, but
hey, we live in a free country, don't we?
OK, to start off, I've
been an avid reader of the
Discorder for a while now
(Please no more cliches!).
The reason is because this
is the one newspaper where
people can write what they
feel without the fear
of...GASP...censorship.
Now, to my point: bqth of
the past responses have
been blatantly racist and
r   a   couple   of
"Al-
tale
fucked-up, middle class
white youth with no ambition to play to their peers."
Sure MC Hammer's and
C&C Music Factory's lyrics don't cut it for me either, but then you have a
lot of "Black American
music" with very meaningful lyrics, such as Public
Enemy. The same holds
true for alternative music:
You have your meaningful
lyric groups like the
Smiths, or Bauhaus, but
then you get shit groups
like Nirvana(can I please
hear  that  song   one  more
Why does music have
to be classified in the first
Is
be
larketed easier?
Sorry, getting off top-
:. Back to before: Both of
aur responses(you know
ho you are) had good
aims, but calling people
"limies" or telling people
that if it weren't for the all-
good White Americans
(oxymoron please!), "your
black African friends
would   still   be   running
" Abattoir" in Discorder
is   one  of  your  best  o
Thanks for your

Mr.   Killaj
■ithl<
a theii
dicks and wooden spears in
their hands" just doesn't cut
it. Yes, I do listen to alternative music, and yes(sic) I
do have homey friends too,
and we get along great.
When will you people wake
up and smell yourselves?

we have bigger problems

his favorite Gastown pizza
place closed down. What
was the name of it? Pizza
Delight?
It's always pleasing when I
get a letter, besides the usual "'Abattoir' sucks" response, letting me know
that the job I do
pie at the
mighty "R" . Concerning
Scooter (gee, isn't that the
name of the same malodorous, flee-bitten, mixed-
breed hound that lives in
my neighborhood scrounging through bits of garbage
late at night), your attempt
at sarcasm in the redemption ofthe Georgia Straight
article went over a lot of
people's heads. Sarcasm
usually falls short of cheap
laughs   when   used   within
erally apathetic city; people need prodding to see
local acts), well I won't
mention their name here.
I'm not involved with them
anyway. BUT, isn't it curious that a radio station and
music rag with a mandate
to play and support local,
independent bands slags
off one and the same. I
mean, the band in question
isn't a rock darling of
CFOX covers. I wonder if
alternative music fans criticize each other too much
for their taste. Not all of us
are fans of a barrage of distorted guitar noise, badly
mixed, hardly audible from
te speakers of some
grunge band playing the
Arcadian Hall! And I laugh
every time you slag off
Coast 800/1040 for their
playlist. Sorry, mighty
"R," but YOU were playing a lot of the same songs
back in 1979, 80, 81...etc.
was available then on radio. Don't deny your own
history. Cue editor's witty.
Yours truly.

statement that our mandate

Dear Airhead,
I'm sick of reading about
how people feel about M.
Jules Killam's articles in the
"Airhead" section of the
Discorder.
I can't understand why
er that's so arrogant—is
given a whole page, it's almost as much of a waste as
"Junkflesh." If you're going to give a whole page to
somebody make it worthwhile! As for the cartoons,
I think Blaine Thurier's
"Everything's Ducky" is
great. I also liked A.O.
Chapman's article in the
February issue, and he said
a hell of a lot more in that
one article than Killam's
said in the last three issues.

those fucking irritatingly

music. What I need help in
is what to buy and look
for. Well, again, I need
help in knowing what to
look for, what names of
artists/bands to buy, and
what are the classics ofthe
kind of music I'm looking
for.
Perhaps there is someone in your magazine staff,
or someone in your readers audience, who knows a
lot about the music I need
help in? Perhaps they
could help me and make a
nice list of their»personal
favorites? Of course, the
larger the list, the better.

not all CDs can be bought

In regards to your ILl-

Dear Airhead,
Re: Review of Deprogrammers' demo in March issue
I would like to thank
you for reviewing my tape.
All press is good press. Al
the
risk of be
ng a
of jumping on the slagfest
bandwagon I feel it necessary to comment on a few
points though.
First of all, Deprogrammers are not, have
not, and most likely will
not ever be "punk rawk."
Or even "punk rock" for
that matter. The search for
pigeon-holes is an irritation, at best, that I try to
avoid. If, however, you insist on looking for a convenient box to stick my
music in could you please
look a little further than
"punk rawk."
Secondly, there is a
slight grammatical error I
would like to point out.
Am I picky or what? Oh
ill; just one of my pel
eves I guess. Anyways,
nquei
"It's heavy, lots of drum
and intensity although I
prefer them live; though
less trippy drum machine
type
of
The
though" after the semicolon is unnecessary. Perhaps proofrea
proper grammar
things to get into when
you're "punk rawk" and all.
The third, and last,
point in my picky tirade is
to address the question
posed at the end of the review. I really don't see how
that is pertinent to a reviewer of my music. It was
probably just the "punk
rawk" thing to do.
So there it is. My
apologies if I come off
sounding picky, uptight,
or negative.  I really  do
appre
the   i
We need all the forums
for local acts that we can
get. It wouldn't hurt to be a
little more thorough and
professional though. Thank
you very much.

APRIL   22
TOWNPUMP I innneapoUs/StPaul.Minne-
is one of those places
seem to overflow with
musical talent. During the eighties
bands like Pere Ubu, Husker Dii, The
Replacements, and Soul Asylum virtually had the monopoly on those
angst ridden punk anthems that used
to put the straddle on the mosl discerning listener. Transforming apret-
ty normal example of the human
species into an axe wielding, metal
king reaching for that elusive note
while grimacing wilh all the fury one
canmuster. While Run Westy Run's
records are noticeably different from
the bands mentioned above they share
the same urgency and honesty. They
also lack pretension which is almost
a requirement in Minnesota (save
Prince and his entourage). Run Westy Run has three albums to date, two
are available on SST records while
the third is available on Twin Tone
records. They came to Vancouver
recently after touring parts of the
coast with fiRehOse. With no current record in the stores, and minimal
promotion, Run Westy Run played
to a strange but good sized crowd at
the Cruel Elephant. I spoke to Kirk,
Kraig, Terrance, John and Daniel of
the band before the gig.
Discorder:How is life in Minneapolis these days?
RWR: Great. Same as it ever was.
The city is trying to close down the
biggest rock club but they have been
trying that for years.
What is it about Minneapolis that
spawns so many bands?
RWR: The water. Ihere are slill a lot
of good bands from Minneapolis Uke
Babes in Toyland.
Doyou guys know Prince and docs
he really have a purple home?
RWR: We can't reaUy reveal that
information, I mean he entrusted us
with that information. He likes to
come down and stage dive and slam
and shit at some of our shows.
It gives him some ideas for his new
stuff ch?
RWR: Exactly.
What is the current situation with
Twin Tone records?
RWR: II's still there but Rough Trade
went belly up right after we put out
our record on their label (The Green
Cat Island record). We were in the
middle of the firsl pressing, on lour
and all of a sudden Rough Trade dies
and Twin Tone got really hurt. They
sold all the pressings and had no
money lo press up any more so it
kinda hurt us. It happened at a time
when they should have really been
pushing it bul they didn't have any
money and all the records were out.
I was quite surprised because I
often see a decent band,like yourselves, whohavearecord produced
by a big name like Peter Buck and
given the right promotion of the
band, in conjunction with this producer, some good things can happen. I really liked the Green Cat
Island record but I couldn't help
notice that it sort of fell into obliv-
RWR: I think that was a big part of it.
The facl lhat ihere was no record, for
somelhing like six or seven months.
We did get really good press on it but
if people can't find it.
So where does that leave you guys
now in terms of a label?
RWR: We are searching. We opted
out of the contract. We are working
a demo right now in hopes that
willing to pul it out.
You guys must have lots of stuff
on backlog that you want to get
RWR: Last year was kind of a
weird summer because Kyle
(former bass player) decided he
just didn't want to be in a band any
more. We didn't really know if we
wanted to quit or not so we took a
couple of months off and decided
we didn't want to, and went up to
New York to get John . We then
found out about Ihis tour with fiRehOse, so we had lo leach John aU
ihe old stuff.
Are you guys more comfortable
in the studio or when playing
live?
RWR: Uve.
Is the studio a bit of a drag because it can be a slow process.
RWR: WeU, I know I get reaUy
So what plans do the band have
for the next little while?
RWR: Do this demo, gel it sounding good, and then start working on
a record. Sean Slade is going to
produce with another guy who has
done alol of bands from Boston.
They have worked with Buffalo
Tom. So we are going out to New
York to tour, and mix an EP.
We also might be going over to
England to play with the guys from
Swervedriver. Apparently they
want us to go over and play some
gigs with them. We played with
them in Toronto; ihey had just lost
their bass player and drummer so
John and I (Daniel) flew up to meet
them, rehearsed in the afternoon,
and played lhat nighl. It was reaUy
fun, people reaUy gol inlo it.
I wanted to ask you guys a bit
about your songwriting. Some of
your songs have great melodies
and others are sort of grinding
on a riff.
RWR: We aU just bring in ideas
and major blocks of stuff and
bounce them off each other.
To Kirk: How do you go about
writing lyrics? What leaves an
impression on you, what inspires
you to write?
Kirk: Sometimes I jusl make them
up.
John: Your mom helps you write
them sometimes.
Is it essential to hear the music
first?
RWR: No, sometimes I have them
written down and I just wait for the
right one to come around. I've got
one lhat I've been waiting for but I
don't hear it in my head.
Terrance: He got tired of waiting
for us so he mailed it off to Mike
Watt.
Kirk: He's already got a song for
Is he going to sing it or are you?
Kirk: He sings it to Ed and then Ed
picks up on it and goes with it.
They already have a song!
RWR: We might make a single of
it. You know, their version and
our version but they can't send us
their version until we have got
ours done because we could get
influenced by it.
RWR: They have really helped us
out, taking us to towns we wouldn' t
normaUy gel to. Or if we did 10
people would show, so it has been
good. They have taken us on a
couple tours trying to give us a
So haveyou noticed some of that
stuff helping you?
RWR: Not alot of people know
about us so we have been lucky
that friends of ours in bands have
helped us get a bit of a base going.
We have a good booking agent
loo.
Why was there this concious decision to not headlinefora while.
RWR: Probably because we wanted to play to some people (laugh).
When Green Cal Island came out
we toured the East Coast and it
was alright but when we started
heading into the deep south it started to get real hard on our morale.
Even on a major label it is the
same. Swervedriver were selling
out aU over the east coast and they
said that in the south it was hurting.
So what sells in the south?
RWR: fiRehOse and Lynard Sky-
What is your best gig ever?... in
the world?
RWR: There have been alot of
good ones. Tampa , in a dome, it
was a nightmare. It was at the
University of South Florida in
Tampa. They moved the gig from
a bar that was just fine into this
smaU arena. Our sound man and
Ught man were Uke three decks
up; hke two blocks away. Over
one hundred people came to see us
but it was just... One big echo.
John: One question for you. I've
been hearing alot aboul Vancouver and this Nardwuar guy.
Nardwuar is the guy that got
healed by Ernest Angley. He
writes for Discorder, sets up gigs,
he does all kinds of things.
RWR: Wow.
Thanks very much guys and
good luck.
RWR: Thanks.

J_> J and burritos, in San Francisco about two years ago,
This Is Our Daughter are an
alternative, hard rock combo
consisting of four experienced
musicians. Their style has been
compared to the Ukes of Concrete Blonde and Jane's Addiction. Their determination has
sent them up and down the west
coast several times. OveraU a
mighty fine chat with singer
Danny Benatar, guitarist Chris,
drummerRandy Gzebb and bass
player Whitey T. Cox. Keep yer
eyes peeled.
Discorder: Let's start out with
a boring question about how
the band got formed.
D: About our past? No, we don't
wanna talk about our past, we
might incriminate ourselves.
W: Police are looking for us, we
still have to get across the border.
D: I'd say the band is about two
years old. It's kind of a conglomeration of other bands.
We've all been in other bands,
signed and stuff, and we just got
this band together; it was a nucleus.
W: We've all been botched by
record companies.
R: Many times, many times....
D: We bent over a lot. We're all
from San Francisco, we've all
known each other for awhile.
The music scene there is pretty
small, every other band knows
every other band. So we just got
together and formed This Is Our
Daughter.
Are you popular in the Seattle
and Portland scenes?
D: Yah, we're starting to become popular because we're
doing a lot of touring up the west
coast; back and forth, establishing a basis.
How did your demo do?
D: The demo did quite well. We
did a couple of them, we' re shopping the new one right now.
What about the cover? I
know when I first saw it I was
young and easily offended...
R: Now you're old and easily
offended!
No, when I first saw it I
thought, "O my goodness..."
D: "They're sexist."
But it isn't. One of you explained to me that it was showing the girl getting exactly
what she wants.
D: Well, basically what you
have is a naked girl with money
on her, and this guy; it's pretty
indicative ofthe business don't
you think?
But did you get any negative
reactions from that?    Were
people refusing to play it because of the cover?
D: No...
C: Actually we have a hard time
keeping our T-shirts in stock.
They keep getting stolen  'cuz
it's got the picture on it.
D: People Uke it, they think it's
So this is the new
guy ..(pointing to Chris) .
C: I'm Chris, I've been with
them for about 2 or 3 months.
Glenn left abruptly and the band
had a show in Santa Cruz opening for a pretty big band, at a
pretty big venue, and they need -
ed someone right away. So they
handed me a tape and I just
walked on stage and we pulled
it off.
Congratulations.
D: That's what we said.
C: That's how easy it is kids.
W: Then we got him laid so he
decided to stick around.
D: Yeah, that was the real topping.
C: A fantastic sexual experi-
Have you toured the east
coast?
D: Not with this band, we've
just done the west coast.

§ by Emma Lauder
And has being in a lot of bands
helped you learn what you
want with this band?
(        W: It lets us be more angry and
a little more wise about making the same mistakes.
R: You learn what you don't
want to.
W: You still end up having to
go through them no matter how
hard you try to avoid them.
** You still gotta deal with the
same shit, but at least you don't
let it bother you as much.
D: It's important wilh a group
like this just to keep on touring
and play clubs.
W: For me I like playing live
£ morethanrecordingoranyoth-
er aspect of the business. As
long as we're on stagel'm happy-
Would you describe your
band as really fun or more
politically  aware lyrically
J        R: Neither.
D: You think this is fun? Politics are for the politicians.
We're very socially conscious
but not within our music.
My puppy really liked the
tape, she chewed on it.
"       D: There yeah go, we actually
try to influence animals.
R: We need some farm animals
on the cover.
D: Especially since we don't
have any women that we can
pick up. Small towns y'know,
j       animals will do.
So Glenn told me you're Pat
Benatar's brother?
D: No, no relation at all.  You
think I'd be sitting here if that
was true, I'd be rich!
I've been lied to!
W: You're lucky he didn't steal
t       from you!
He also told me, but I didn't
believe this, that Randy was
the former drummer for
Jane's Addiction.
D: That's true.
Well, sure and you guys stole a
local band's show?
C: Well they weren't able to
play after they got beat up.
D: See, that's our thing, we try
to beat up the headlining act.
W: It's our gimmick.
Does it work?
W: So far.
D: But they've all been girls
that usually headline so that's
the people we beat up.
W: That or English bands which
are about the same thing.
D: Otherwise we're doing really good, we're getting some interest with some smaU labels.
Is that a big deal for you to get
a label?
D: I think the big deal is to get
some interest from a lot of record
companies so we can pick and
choose.
Is that your ultimate goal, or
are you happy enough just
touring and making music?
D: Well the ultimate goal would
be to gel the deal and do the
music at the same time; go into
the studio, cut a good album and
stay on the road.
C: And initiate a bidding war.
Have you been close to that
before, with other bands?
D: We've all been in bands that
have been signed and on labels.
C: I did a lour with an English
band called the Mission U.K. I
was supposed to play Vancouver wilh them but they had to
cancel 'cuz of border hassles,
so I've finally made it back to
Did you guys have problems
crossing the border?
C: Extremely.    They tried to
entrap us on some cocaine rap.
C: They found some battery acid
on a floorboard, asking us what
the hell it was.
Does that discourage you from
coming up here?
D: No, we like playing up here
in Vancouver.
R: Vancouver's a great city.
W: Good beer. Good stripjoints.
0alk through Zurich's financial district to the park behind the National Museum
of Switzerland, and you are
suddenly at a scene of human carnage. PlatzspitzPark is littered with
hundreds of people thrusting needles into their arms and necks. Blood
faUs to the grass. Bodies overload
the park's benches, heads dangle at
impossible angles, eyes roll back.
Drug-filled syringes stick from
scarred flesh. The field of bodies
has the appearance of a war zone,
rather than the approved drug program of the Zurich City Council it
actually is.1
Nearing five years since its
inception "the world's foremost free
needle experiment"2 —implemented in a globaUy criticized and ridiculed effort to quarantine and stifle
the city's increasing percentage of
addicts testing HIV positive - has
been terminated.
In the same week that
Platzspitz Park is boarded up and a
regiment of drug dependents turned
back to the streets of Zurich and the
rural communities ihey abandoned
for the freer access to drugs that
Zurich promised, Switzerland's
Young Gods, suppliers of sinister
sample-laden punk, release their
fourth LP TV Sky.
Young Gods' vocahst Franz
Treichler is quick to rule out any
coincidence between these two
"I'm glad you talk about this
in a way, because this is also one of
the sides of Switzerland that is not
aU cous-cous and chalets. It's pretty wild. It's Uke a horror movie. I
think Switzerland is some
kind of clinical country and
Treichler The LP is the result of our
need to hear something more rock-y,
more straight, more direct, after having shown all our European influences with L'Eau Rouge and the Kurt
Weill LP. For 7VS*y we just wanted
to have a more straight line. Everything is done with guitars, bits of
guitars reversed and sped up, ralher
than samples.
HOWARETHEYOUNGGODS
A PRODUCT OFTHEIR ENVIRONMENT?
I think in a purely practical point of
view Switzerland helped us to develop the Young Gods and to keep
on doing it. Here, you've got a lot to
do by yourself because there isn't
any infrastructure. There are two,
maybe three, labels, and no majors
are going to be interested. I think
we carried on. We believed in what
we wanted to do, and that helped us
a lot. That was a good side of being
a Swiss band.
CARE TO DISCUSS YOUR
WORK AS A
PRODUCER...YOUR WORK
WITH TREPONEM PAL AND
AL COMET'S (YOUNG GODS-
SAMPLER) EUROP PIRAT
TOUR RELEASE?
I think I can trigger people. I'm
pretty good at making them feel
secure and understanding their ideas
becauseof some of what I've learned
in the studios with the Young Gods.
It's also very interesting for me to
be on the other side of the desk
because I leam how to work in the
sound engineer language which you
have to when you evolve in the
studio. Treponem Pal in their style, are
a very creative band. Al's solo project
is something whichlrespectcompletely. I like the attitude: they go with one
car, playing in bars and pubs, playing
for drinks, doing two or three Utile
showsof twenty minutes in oneevening,
and then they drive to the next town. I
think this is a bit keeping in the tradition
of "troubadours," we say in French,
which is great.
It was a Uve project first and then,
when we toured for Veau Rouge we
included some Kurt WeUl songs in
our repertoire: "Seeauber Jenny,"
"Salmon Song," "Speaklow,"
"Mackie Messer." We wanted to
record a live gig including these
songs but the whole thing came out
really bad. We played bad! technically il was bad. Everything was
bad. (Laughs) So bad we went back
io ihe studio and recorded them
When we played Montreal for the first
time Ihey played for us in the rehearsing room and we made friends with
them and spent some time together.
The second lime we played Montreal,
we had problems with one of our samplers and Blackie, ihe bass player,
showed up with his samplerjust before
the show. All the shops were closed,
but they helped us out.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO
PROVIDE FOR YOUR LISTENERS?
We try to make some kind of sea of
sound...something you can swim
into. Energy basicaUy, but positive
energy. We Uke seeing people getting out of a gig with a lot of creative energy...like a shower of
sound that gets you rid of all the
Uttle things you mix up in your
HAVE THE YOUNG GODS
EVER BEEN ACCUSED OF
BEING CONNECTEDTO FASCIST ELEMENTS?
No, :
. We v
in a way, a very no-future
country. I think there's a
strange kind of cloud over
HOW  WOULD  YOU
DESCRIBE TV Sky?
YOUNG GODS
quoted as being very Wagnerian,
very masochistic, or even Ni-
elzschean, but I guess it's more due
to the name of the band...the massive sound. There was one song
which was a bit of a controversy -
"Les Enfants" - because of the
drumming and the massive classical samples.
IS IT DIFFICULT TO TOUR
CONSIDERING YOURANNU-
AL OBLIGATION TO THE
SWISS ARMY?
Normally you've got to spend four
months the first time and then three
weeks every year. I didn't spend
more then one moming. I don't
know why they didn 'i want to keep
me. (Laughs). I made a massive
impression on them that I didn't
wanl to do it and I never wanted to
do it... and they understood.
The Young Gods are currently in
Scotland, performing ihe first series of dates of an eight month
world tour that wiU bring them to
Vancouver in early June.

"Sunday in the Park" in
Mother Jones, February/
March 1990.
by Lloyd llCiam Bust the other night I was witness to a great pop-think-in
over at the Cruel Elephant.
The date was Saturday, February 15 and the bands were Bum,
Mr. Wrong, The Show Business
Giants, and The Sweaters. Coincidence or not, aU these bands
are from, or have at least originated from an always vibrant
rock city, Victoria BC. Fascinated by this water-locked scene, I
talked to Tom HoUiston of The
Show Business Giants after
their fantastic show:
Discorder: Ok Tom, Show
s Giants, where and
Where? On an island, caUed the
Garden City. The entire island is
the Garden City. There's no
bridge to it so don't try to get to
it thai way. ... um... what? Five
people and we like rock and roll.
So basically you could be called
the "Garden City Rockers"
Yes, Grant.
Tell me about you keyboardist, her name is... Sue?
No, it's Jennye, spelt with a y-e
instead of e-y.
That's kind of nutty, is that
like a "punk" thing she developed when she was like 15,
writing it over and over on her
binder?
ActuaUy, she used to be a professional model and decided she
needed a twist to her moniker.
And you're dating her, is that
right?
No, I'm not. No.
Hhmm...that's funny. Didn't
you   tell mc awhile ago that
No! I never said I was, although
I may have hinled it with the
subtle raise of an eyebrow.
Um...while you were playing,
behind that drum cage I noticed someone I had seen before. Was he in another band?
Yes, he slill is. He's in NoMeansNo. 'Ihey' re kind of dormant al
the time.
And do you live with him?
No, I don'l but I go over lo his
house for omelettes every day.
And his name is Bill?
No...he does have a lol of them,
but his name is John Wright.
I heard a rumor that NoMeansNo have broken up.
No, they have nol.
So what's the story?
The status of NoMeansNo is
something I really don't think I
should talk about because they
haven't really figured it out them
selves. But they are not broken
up-
Torn, what's wrong with Vancouver?
Oh, I don't think there is anything wrong with it, I don't Uve
Why do you only play the
Cruel Elephant?
Nobody wants to book us anywhere else. We've had a lot of
trouble getting shows in Vancouver. I think we're playing
the Railway Club in March. We
also tried to get a show in Whistler, but we never got a return
caU. We're still working on lhat
with a gendeman by the name
of Frank Weiport who seems
Uke quite an immenable[sic]
type of person. He also seems
Uke he has a lot of meat on his
plate and doesn't know where
to start cutting.
What releases can   Vancouverites buy from the Show
Business Giants?
A couple of tapes that are sold
out, and   a couple of singles.
The first single was called
"Blobs Volume 1," on Way Out
Records. It's a Victoria label
run by a guy named Rick Andrews who runs Fun House
Records Store. It was a compilation with ourselves, Shovlhed,
and the Hansen bros.
What kind of music do the
Hansen Bros, play?
They play punk rock
Anything else?
We're on "Blobs Vol. 2," as
weU, with ihc SquireUs.  Then
we were going to put out a CD
but then I talked to a personality
in Vancouver who attempted lo
dissuade us from putting oul a
CD, lo pul out another single
instead. So whal we decided to
do is put oul a CD and put out a
single afterwards.
Why afterwards? Arcn'tthey
supposed to come before?
Wc just don't have the means to
put out both al ihe same lime.
I don't understand! Why arc
you putting out a CD?
It's quile cheap for us to do, wc
can have a friend master it for
$150 as opposed lo the olher
places that quote $500 or $600.
And we can save that money
and pul it towards a single.
And you don't like vinyl.
No, I like vinyl! I'vegotnolh-
ing against vinyl, I've got nothing against CDs, I've got nothing against either, it's just mu-
Good point. Nobody has ever
said that. I'm always duelling
with people on the CD versus
viny I thing and no one has ever
said "it's just music."
Also, I'm the kinda guy who
Ukes to rock oul. That's why
CDs are betteratparties. Records
just get stepped on or have beer
poured on them. But one thing I
hate is CDs with, like, 70 minutes of music on them, it's just
too much. It should be 35 or 40
minutes at the most. We're gonna put out a 45 minute CD, at the
What label is it gonna be on?
This will be on Way Out Records
Are you employed?
Yes, I'm a musician.
No, no, are you employed?
Yes, I consider being a musician
employment.
It's a very hard life if you're a
musician. The scary thing
about being a musician, especially an independent one,
when you're not like Nirvana
or Hammer, the scary thing is
every day you age. And one
day you're gonna be too old
for the kids to accept. Time
and age are probably two of
the most frightening things in
this world, besidesfat, masonic republicans. That's what I
worry about. I mean, sure, we
can go on and keep playing
bars until we're ripe, or stale
and what do we do after that?
Reap in the benefits of your suc-
What if the benefits of your
success amount to about
$20.00?
That would be a big plus right
But what do you do when the
grains of the hour glass run
Ihe way I see il is if I went to
university and gol a Masters degree in, like, Marine Biology,
I'd be unemployed anyway, so
what's the difference?
You mean you wouldn't be at
Sea World helping little baby
whales die?
I've thoughtabout it and thought
aboul il and have realized lhal
the most important thing in your
Ufe is to do what you wanl lodo

That's great. Thanks for talking to me, Tom. I wish the

§TRAIGHT OUTTA BREMERTON comes the tremor
shaking the foundations ofthe
Northwest region right now
and that tremor has a name; The
Daves. Formed in December of'89
half of the band, namely singer Bob
and guitarist Aaron, met while on a
ferry  from
(a satellite
of Seattle)
lo  Seattle.
thing being really cheap, but within that cheap scene is the crowd of
people that we're trying lo access
ourselves to. When we can get it
it's good but along with the cheap
shows come cancels, or the party
we're supposed to play at had the
cops show up just as we're loading
The meet-
chance and
ly a forum
for Aaron to
ask if his already estab.-
I i s h e d
band —
which Bob
would later
join—could
play a party
atBob'sbe-
house"happened to be
a       place
ing a lot of big parties and there
was a time when we did have bands
play," includes Bob. Humble beginnings, but one not uncommon
to any band trying to get a seat on
the musical chair of success.
Since that merge of talent in
1989 the Daves have migrated to
The Home of the 1962 World's
Fair (Seattle, for all of you non-
almanac readers) and actually live
together as a band. The migration
to Seattle was an obvious and unavoidable choice so the band could
be a part of the major music circuit
the town has to offer. "You can't
expect to get anywhere out of
catching ferries for shows," adds
Bob; an intolerance, definitely a
hindrance. Bul one might think the
members living, breathing, and
playing together to be somewhat
of a pain in the ass as well: "Sometimes things enter into the band
situation that shouldn't, personality conflicts and what not, bul
that's life," explains Aaron.
So, despite the internal band
problems, which are shared by
bands universally, The Daves have
generated quite the large amount
of hype, on both sides of our friendly border, on the strength of their
adrenalin-emanating live performance and their SOLD OUT independent demo release. With the
scene of the Northwest being as
active as it is, and Seattle being a
virtual melting-pot for new talent,
one has to wonder jusl how easy,
or difficult, it is to be heard and
recognized: "Around here it's more
like who you're friends with,"
Aaron explains. "And you don't
even have to be that good as long
as you know the right people," Bob
elaborates. "Bul we've been pretty successful as far as getting the
name around," continues Aaron.
"It's a low budget scene. There's a
couple of places where we can play
that are dumps and dives, and
there's the problem with every-
our stuff in."
But with the trough of every
wave is a crest and those waves
have reached tsunami proportion
as of (ale with successful gigs at
Seattle's Off Ramp and OK Hotel,
and a Northwestern blitz with
JFA—including The Daves' phenomenal debut at the Cruel Elephant's new location grand opening. Not only did The Daves surprise the hell out of all in attendance with their aggessively primitive-core but they also staked their
first claim in The Land of Clam
Chowder and Ice.
"It's [Canada] not America;
it's almost a European thing," explains Bob on the reaction the band
received in Canada. "America is
used to the Sub Pop, long-hair rocker thing. It's just turned into a bull-
rock festival in Seattle. And I think
we need to play that Cruel Elephant
again "cuz they owe us some money. They stiffed us for $90 bucks so
they owe us a show and $90 bucks!"
ng The Daves live it
o surprise as to why the
popular with the growing budget side of core they prescribe themselves to. With a scene
that window-dresses even the
grunge side of rock for commercial
appeal, The Daves steer away from
the proven rock formula and nestle
comfortably outside the musical in-
frastuclure.
However, they do go back to
their house party roots every once
in a while, if not for an ego boost,
for a couple cases of beer. "For a
while house parties were all we
were willing to do," explains Bob,
"because we still had to work out
some of the kinks and we thought
that was the only place we could
get away with our fuck-ups. Ii took
us about 6 months to play a real
show because we wanted to make
sure that the impression the people
got when they saw us was that we
kick fucking ass!"
After s
"Just think, 3 months...a year
down the road those people are gonna go 'Goddam, who was that band
that came and destroyed our
house?!?' They won't know but everybody else lhat came and spit on
their walls will," Aaron emphatically states. So if you've been wondering why your
fave China has
fallen from its pre-
the hutch it's probably because The
Daves have
played/are playing
a house party in
your neighbor-
As I mentioned earlier The
Daves' latest demo
release has sold
out all of its first
pressing which
isn't surprising.
Bob(vocals),
Aaron (guitar),
Shawn (drums),
and Bobby (bass)
are probably the
most      intrinsic
of the Northwest
with a sound similar to the pioneer-
punk from the So.Cal. coast. The 4
track, 9 song demo, recorded "in a
living room in Bremerton" by their
friend Tony, captures the Daves'
live angst and packs the political
weight of the Dead Kennedys in a
Rollins-type delivery. Prodded
along by Bob's vocal charisma,
Aaron, Shawn and Bobby drive the
funk-inspired, "green means
sealed" tight beast known as politi-
core. "The main thing that we're
trying to say is think for yourself;
be an individual. I don't think anyone is even saying that in a lot of
the other music around, they're
complaining. And I admit I complain a lot in some of our songs but

«) About ten years ago The Leaving Trains left the station of inveteracy for aberrancy. As they
churned into the smoggy sunset,
still sitting on the platform was
their luggage; their worldly pos -
essions. They stood with their
noses pressed to the glass as the
distance between them and normalcy grew larger with every
belch of the engine' s coal starved
gullet. All this could have been
easily corrected with a quick pull
on the engineer's cord, summoning the mighty iron beast to a
shreiking halt but the world contains many surprises. So off they
went: Mo-ron Donovan, Whitey
Sims, Falling James, Lenny Mon-
toya, and Patrick McGroggynot-
begger, with nothing but the
clothes on their backs—and rarely even that!!
"We Uke to get naked, people can't accept il," says Whitey
Sims who used to be the bass
player for the band, but traded it
off for singing with bare-bottomed replacement Patrick Mc-
Groggynotbegger taking the position of bass-head. "When we
played in Seattle we got to play
15 minutes before they turned us
off; they freaked out. Right before we played our roadie peed
in a 40 oz. of beer and a bum
walking a dog drank the whole
thing, which was 3/4 of the way
full. I thought it was a sign that it
was going to be a really good
show and although the show only
lasted 15 minutes, it was a good
show."
"And we still got paid our
400 dollars," adds Patrick.
In the humble ten year existence ofthe band, which for the
majority, has seen them co-hab-
itate with indie heavyweights
SST—after a bilked beginning
with the now-folded Enigma label—the Leaving Trains have
contributed 5 LP's, an EP and
four(?)7" efforts to their always
increasing discography. Their
latest donation to the masses is
titled The Lump In My Forehead
and is indicitive of the mutant
blues/punk style that has been
forged in the pot-belly stove of
the beast. "It deals with very depressing subject matter and very
funny subject matter," says Whitey. "We've been on the road for
so long that we've seen so many
depressing things and so many
funny things, it's no wonder
James popped a tire in his head.
[But that's a story in itself] It's
been unbelievable as far as how
the country is going and things
around the world....Europe
wasn't so bad, they're way more
tolerant."
This may help in explaining why the people of Europe
don't seem to mind that a drunk -
en Los Angeles band, with a
demi-transvestite for a guitarist,
with a tendency—actually, more
of an instinct—to perform naked
are allowed to freely roam the
country. But every country does
have its share of problems with
border crossings and Europe is
not exempt from this. On the
cover of the Leaving Trains' lasl
7" ("Rockin'Roll Murder") single is the headline "Sicko Border
Patrol Strip Searches U.S. Band
And Forces Them To Perform Naked," that band was Leaving Trains
and the border was between Germany and Austria.
"Yeah, they like to do that
stuff so my idea was lo just ride
across the borders completely naked so we could have jusl jumped
out of the car," Whitey solvingly
stales. Eliminate ihe middle man,
so to speak. "They aren't looking
for any drugs, they're just sick perverts who want you to take your
clothes off."
But the members of Leaving
Trains are no strangers to the proverbial birthday suit. Although
some other bands are finding newfound fame in performing naked,
or gearing down whilst the perfor-
Dwarves, Cramps, Tribe 8, and
Perry Farrell (who is but a pup with
his nude performance at a show in
Hawaii some time ago)—Leaving
Trains may have started this whole
revolution; they toured Europe and
the entire United States twice, before anybody had even heard of the
Dwarves or Jane's Addiction.
A point is made of gearing
down and going butt-naked at every show, something Patrick calls
"primal."This accounts for the staggering figure of over 10,000 people
having seen Whitey's penis. Sure,
that number pales in comparison to
somebody like John Holmes(dead)
or Traci Lords(slut) but they were
stars of cellulose. Whitey's admirers are in the flesh! But again the
comparison to pom-stars of yesteryear can be made because while
what the Leaving Trains do is so
different from blatant genital exploitation, they still receive the Tipper Gore-ish reaction from many.
"People are either enjoying it or
they're so fucking repulsed that
they're never gonna forget us.
They'll probably go home and shoot
themselves," Patrick explains with
pride. "Everybody showers naked
or hangs out naked in their house
but they gel so upset when they see
it in person, I can't understand it,"
Whitey head-scratchingly states.
However, some fans are more
receptive lo the Leaving Trains' performance as is proven by an interesting Falling James anecdote in
volving Lydia Lunch. When the
Trains were on tour last summer
James, whom by the way is "totally in love with Lydia Lunch," was
lucky enough to find out that their
tour would be taking them to New
Orleans; the city that Lydia likes to
call home. Coincidentally, Whitey
Sims is originally from New Orleans and still has a lot of friends
there, with connections mind you,
so it wasn't difficult to get Ms.
Lunch's phone number. Now you
have to understand that James, who
was married to now Nirvana mattress Courtney Love(Hole—in both
respects of the word), is in total
love/lust with Lydia and sends her
a constant stream of letters. So
meeting her would rank as a fantasy.
To make a long story short,
"she comes to the show, James pulls
his dress up between his teeth, pulls
his dick out and starts whacking his
meat. He's looking at the audience
and saying, "I could get off on you
and I can't even tell if you're a boy or
a girl,'and people are getting pissed
off and leaving. James actually came
on stage while I was whipping his
ass with a microphone cord," says
Whitey. "Then he wanted people to
smell his hands. Lydia came
up...smells his hands and then took
him out to get pancakes for breakfast
in the morning." Masturbating for
Lydia Lunch got the Trains a song,
"Transposing Heat," for the new
album, imagine what il could do
for you.
But life on the rails for the
Leaving Trains isn't all sex, booze/
drugs and pancakes. When the Trains
were in Seattle last, Falling James
got shot. It wasn't life threatening, it
was only a shot in the leg, but it was
right near his manhood. Coming from
a predominantly white suburb of LA,
Palisades Park, he's fascinated by
black people. However, a neighborhood in Seattle where crack deals are
going down outside the front door
isn't the best place for a drunken,
babbling, dress-wearing exhibitionist to try and strike up a conversation
with the local folk about their heritage.
"So, on top of the bum drinking the pee, the club kicking us out
after 15 minutes, being beat up in
Santa Rosa, San Jose, and Santa
Cruz, this is nothing," shrugs Whitey. "We're gonna quit gettin beat
up and go to Seattle and beat the
shit out of Nirvomit. Then we could
make up l-shirts lhal say "I Beat Up
Kurdt.' So, we're on a mission."
After this the interview turned
into a gossip-fest as we swapped
tales like old war veterans; or grandmas playing Bridge (stereotype?).
I was astonished to leam that Eric
from NoFX had fucked Jennifer
Finch, from L7, in the butt nonetheless, and lhat she's owed Patrick
S50 for well over a year. "She's
gotta tighten those spokes," declares Patrick. The band was as
equally impressed with my tale of
the old roadie from The Best Kissers In the World gelling kicked off
the Smahing Pumpkin/Pearl Jam/
Red Hot Chili Pepper lour after
fucking D'arcy from the Pumpkin:
"What's his name? Where is he,
can we meet him?" asked the band
enthusiastically. Well, wc could
have talked long into the night but
the band had to change James'
dressing and track down the Nirvomit boys after they dug up Jimi
Hendrix's guitar from his, supposed, burial sight in Tacoma.
The Leaving Trains might
seem like one of those bands that
are bent for destruction (or spontaneous combustion) but don't forget lhat they've been doing ihis for
10 years already. And when in
doubt, remember The Little Engine That Could. Choo, choo.

It's a little difficult to imagine the billiard-headed puppy before us would gather up enough energy to slip on the knee-length Everlasts and assist Nitzer Ebb colleagues
Doug McCarthy and session-guy-turned-on-tour percussionest-guy Julian Beeston in whipping the frat guys and girls at the Commodore into a slammin' frenzy just
hours after this interview. And you'd think there's gotta be a better way of spending a mild Saturday afternoon in Vancouver than by being sucked up to by some college
radio flakes, especially if the previous night you "came out second best to a bottle of Bacardi." Nah! So, after waging a battle of the VU meters against Mark Knopfler
andAngusYoung during the PA check, the real chittin' and chattin' with Bon Harris began:

a track called "The Faith Healer" which
was originally by the sensational Alex
Harvey band.
D: Wilder did some production on the EP.
He helped us with "Come Alive" and
that was kind of a dry run before the
album... to see how well the working
relationship would be. It was good to
work with Al on the album... really
helpful. Been a lot of work going on
between Wilder and the Ebb boys re-

D: You're off to South America and Japan
after this?
Possibly, yeah. We end up in New York,
then we'll be going back to England to
do six shows and a few shows in Spain.
And then, it depends... depends on the
Japanesegetting themselves in gear and
getting it organized. We may go to South
America as well. We've been offered a
few concerts there - Paraguay, Uruguay, Peru, Brazil. We're leaving our
plans fairly open, but we've got our
mind to do this Japanese thing.
D: What kind of audiences do you have in
those countries, for instance, are you selling millions of copies of your records in
I wouldn't go that far, but they're two
differentareas. I mean, Japan's obviously
a very market-oriented area. No idea what
the crowds are like 'cause we never actually played there. South America's a slightly different kettle offish I think, because
there's not so much wealth. I think concerts tend to be better attended than actual record sales. It's probably a similar
situation to what we've seen in places like
Spain... very similar approach I would
imagine.
D: Nitzer Ebb was involved in last year's
Reading music festival.
We've been asked the last couple of years
to do it and we've always been doing
albums... never really free. We finished
the album this summer and they asked us
again and we agreed to do it. Quite enjoy
doing festivals every now and again. So,
we turned up, managed to bag the only
nice sunny day out of the whole weekend
and did a good set. Seemed to stand out
because there were so many guitar oriented bands. I think there was one rap group,
so they were the only other band that
weren't using any guitars. I think it made
us stand out quite a lot. Got a lot of
positive reaction. Journalists were saying
that our set was one of the best of the
weekend. That was cool.
es. We do the tracks once and that's how
they stay. Then, Dan Miller wanted to do
it and Geffen wanted to have "Family
Man" on Ebbhead. The instance they cited was like when Soul II Soul did their
album, they didn't put "Back to Life" on
it, and how many people bought it and
were completely bummed out that they
didn't have their favorite single on the
album? When it was presented to us in
that light, we made the concession to put
"Family Man"on the album, but we didn't
include the lyrics because we still considered it slightly separate from the rest of it.
D: Are your romantic lives playing a larger
role in your songwriting?... I'm thinking of
tracks like "Come Alive," "Give lo You"
and "Ascend."
I think that kind of thing's just an element
that was always there. With us, it's just
knowing how to incorporate it and feeling
comfortably with putting it across without
being out of character. It'd be easy for a
track like "Ascend" or "I Give to You" to just
mush out and become a little bit uncharacteristic of us. Whereas we feel with those
tracks, we acheived a kind of softness that we
wanted to get across... a little bit more melody, not so aggressive, a different side to the
music, but still keep the feel about it of Nitzer
Ebb. I think those sides to us have always

down there. There's a good little scene
down there. Got a few friends. We played
there recently on this tour, had a few
technological nightmares but managed to
pull the show off. Something happened
with the PA and all the power went off in
the third number, so we were left in silence for aa lettle while there.
D: Time to bring out the acoustic guitars and
flutes.
The Polynesian nose flute solo... always a
winner!
D: Is there a connection between the lyrics
for "Family Man" not being included on
Ebbhead and the fact that the album didn't
have a parental advisory?
They sl\cV.ereAEbbhead in America. Most
ofthe North American copied have been
stickered. Whether it's a different deal in
Canada, I wouldn't imagine so. Most of
them have got parental advisories because
we're naughty little boys. We originally
didn't want to put "Family Man" on Ebbhead. We counted As Is as a statement in
itself. It was kind of reaction against the
remixmania that goes on in the record
business. We said there is to be no remix-

each other because we had to stick together. Electronic music itself was fairly young and then this kind of aggressive approach to it was even younger, so
I think its just another way of making
music now and we were perhaps among
the first to do it that
way, but I don't
think it's a movement. All those
bands you just mentioned all sound very
different. Got a different approach.
been there, we just put them across more
forcefully in the past.
D: Will Nitzer Ebb be relevant in twenty years
and if so, is that a good thing?
It's difficult to say whether we'll be relevant.
You're not even sure if your next album is
going to be relevant. We've never been sure
that we're ever going to come up with a next
album. Questions like that, I think, if you
dwell too much upon it then you make it a
bigger issuethan it is. I wouldn't have thought
that ten years after we started the band, that
we'd still be relevant or that being in a band
would still be relevant to mc as a person, but
it is. We've never really thought about any of
those things. We just take each thing as it
comes and do it. If it is still relevant then it'll
be a good thing 'cause that means I still
wouldn't have to have a proper job (laughs)
and I'll be 47 years old. So that'll be alright,
wouldn't it? (Laughs.)
D: Nitzer Ebb, Borghesia, Frontline Assembly, Klinik... Would you consider yourselves
part of a movement?
Nah, I don't think so. I think in the early
day s, some of the stuff that was happening in
Europe... it was like everyone acknowledged
^^^^^^^^^™ D: Your videos don't
attract much airplay, are you thinking about
releasing some kind of video package at the
Yeah, we'd like to do a long form video
one day, but it's finding the right way to
present it. We don't just want to stack our
videos together and throw in some live
footage and be done with it. We've had a
video camera on the road with us this
time, so we've been shooting more footage. Maybe we'll edit that together. But
we would like to release it 'cause we've
done a lot 'cm and they're a pain.
D: But an Ebb video consists of you just
skipping down streets like maniacs, it's not
like you're using any kind of M.C. Ham-
mer-esque choreography.
Nah, it's just all the waiting around. I've
gotta go do one tomorrow... a video for
"Ascend"... done some remixes of "Ascend." So, we gotta leave the rest of the
tour, fly down to L.A., get out and film for
one day and then fly and meet back up in
time for the gig in Salt Lake City which
you don't really need.
D: Couldn't you have done anything in
Vancouver?
I like it here, but the whole thing was
they wanted it to be done in the desert.
Not a lot of desert in Vancouver this
time of year.
D: You can wade ihrough a sewage treat-
I'd rather go to L.A. actually (laughs)
than stand in raw sewage. Yeah, I do
like the scenery around here. I was
looking at it this morning on the way
in, looking at the mountains and stuff.
I've been dying to try snowboarding
for years.
D: Anyone in your field that ii

were among your favorites.
Chili Peppers is still well up there. I
think their latest record is excellent. I

OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK Hribe 8 is a self-profassod "girl band for
girlz. " (If you don't "gat" their name, look
up tribade in the dictionary). They're
grungy, crunchy, sleazy and smart — oh yeah, and
not really interested in hiding their preference
for sharing their blankets with girlz.
Bhey' ve been playing around San Francisco for
about a year and have sold out their first
8-song cassette which included the now
classic tunes "Neanderthal Dyke, " "Powerboy " (about
police brutality), "Lezophobia" and "1 Party 2
Many. " The Tribe is slated to put out a couple of
indie singles soon and will also appear on an
upcoming compilation featuring such denizens of
the thriving underground girl scene as Bikini
Kill, 7 Year Bitch, and The Lucy Stoners. Their
contribution is called "I Just Wanna Manipulate My
Girlfriend". Hmmm, sounds like something you might
want to pawn your Barbie collection for. Anyway,
they' re planning to do some touring this spring and
might even get to Europe this summer, so check your
local listings and don't miss em'.
WP    ribe   8's   aggressively   frank   treatment   of
I      sexual politics and mainstream gay culture
  pretty much precludes their total acceptance
by all dykes, let alone your average shred-head.
One woman I met went out of her way to tell me she
thought they were "rude, obnoxious and nasty and
can't even play their instruments. " That's when
I knew for sure I'd like them. So I asked around
for them and eventually convinced them to sit down
and chat about their music, live shows and the San
Francisco scene. Present and accounted for at the
chin-wag were Leslie (guitar), Lynne Breedlove
(vocals), and Mania (bass). Unavailable for
comment were drummer Kat and guitarist Flipper.
Leslie: We've been together
for about a year. I went to this
party and Lynne and Flipper and
Kat were playing, it was the
first thing they ever did, and
they had maybe 4 songs that they
kept playing over and over.
Lynne Breedlove: There were
five actually and we made them
up in one week.
L: And I thought, that's cool.
Then Lynne started yelling that
they needed a bass player and I
said I'd play bass with them and
she started yelling "Hey, we
got a bass player." I didn't
know any of them and they didn't
know each other really well
either.
LB: We called Kat and asked her
if she could play drums and she
said "Well, I haven't played in
four years, but I'll give it a
shot."
Mahia: I never knew all this.
L: Then we started playing in
the back room of someone's
house and it was really loud.
IB: We had to sound-proof it
because the landlord's wife was
dying or something.
So   1

stage for your delivery of
"Powerboy"; that song about
police brutality and homophobia?
IB: Because the line in it goes
"you got your night stick, your
surrogate dick." I just thought
we gotta do something, we got so
little talent we got to get
ourselves some props. So I went
over to Stormy Leather and they
had this big old gnarly, ugly,
rubber thang for just $13. So I
said,   "That's forme."
L: That's slightly more than
a dollar an inch.
L: Yeah, except the straight
boys, they tend to look down
between their own legs and feel
a bit inferior.
M: Definitely. They are totally open and cool, and I think
they purposely cultivate ambiguous sexuality.
L: They're very queer positive.

straight - we were all so

L: So we had to find a real

if we had more people in the
band it would be cheaper. So
that's when I switched to guitar and we got Mahia on bass.
M: Oh, that's how it happened.
Oh my god, I'm so pissed off.
IB: Mahia actually sounds the
best 'cuz she actually has
experience on her instrument.
L: Our first gigs were at
parties, then seme benefits.
L: Our first show was totally
great. It was probably the
first time I had ever seen that

R See, we had put out our own
leaflet that said "Fuck Pete Wilson, Fuck Frank Jordan, Fuck the
Police, Fuck This, Fuck That."
IB: "...Fuck Everything, Die
Die Die," and some right-wing
asshole shows up at the dub,
Cafe San Disco, waving the
flyer and saying "you ""ade a
mistake. You don't have your
permit yet and we can make life
hell for you." So the bar
manager calls me and tells us we
can't play if we didn't take the
flyers down right away. She
said the police called and said
they couldn't have any punk
rock acts playing there because
they' re too loud. So I made the
mistake of telling her I didn't
think punk rock was a "volune
re really into supporting this AB 101 Defense
Fund thing, AND, it was in her
best interest 'cuz we can draw
hundreds of people and they
drink a lot of beer. So she
says, "Okay, you can play and
the police will look the other
M: But they told Lynne that she
had to agree not to take her top
off;  no pulling dicks out.
L: And they told her she
couldn't suck anything.
IB: So then we go around and
tell all our friends that they
had to go to the gig, 'cuz we
were really big shit, and they
had to support the AB 101 thing.
M: The most fun was that
Berkley gig, a benefit for
People's Park when they wanted
to mow it down and make it into
a bunch of volleyball courts.
L     But another one was the No
Apologies, No Regrets benefit. It
was for the people who were
arrested during the riots which
followed the defeat of the AB
101 amendment which would have
given gays legal rights in
California; like they couldn't
lose their housing or jobs over
issues of sexual orientation.
Anyway, it turned into this big
fight between us and the bar
hosting the event, who became
really worried that we were too
controversial and would vpset their
level" and that maybe we weren' t
quite the kind of band she
wanted playing at her bar ' cuz,
"we ain't no fucking lounge
act, we're super intense, anarchist, pornography punk rock
motherfuckers - we be suckin'
dick, we be takin' our clothes
off, maybe we better re-think
this whole thing." She said,
"Fine, don't play." Then I
realized that my ass would be
grass if everyone got home from
the Grand Canyon and found out
we weren't gonna play this gig,
so I realized I had to start
kissing her ass. So I said,
"What was on those flyers? Oh
really, I didn't even know what
was on them." Then I told her
it would be a real drag if we
couldn't play the benefit be-
M: It was really big, tons of
people came out, people we

were yelling, pushing, shoving
and slanming. Then their show
got cut short and people got
pissed off.

When you think about it, girl groups have been around for
a long time (although for some, a shorter time than we remember). From the beat groups of Motown, to the Sunset Strip in
L.A. in the Fifties and Sixties, to heavy rock in the Seventies
(who here remembers Fanny?), to the commercialized sugar-
coated sugar pop ofthe Eighties. The widely known phenomenon of girls 'n' guitars has since become a more explosive trend
which has continued on into the Nineties where "I am woman,
hear me rock!" is an anthem heralded by many a younger, more
aggressive bands striving to make themselves heard instead of
only talked about.
Following this current wave along with the likes of L7, the
Lunachicks, and Frightwig, are Minneapolis' Babes In Toy-
land. Formed in 1988, this trio (although they were once a
quartet) of Kat Bjelland(on lead guitar and vocals), Michelle
Leon(on bass), and Lori Barbero(on drums) went from just bare
bones chords to a unique brand of scuzrock that has left many
heads turning and legions of fans bowing at their feet.
Their story begins in 1989. Upon recording a single on an
independent label and playing tons in their hometown, they hit
the road, and many people(including myself) became instant
fans ofthe "Babes". Not merely because they were a bunch
of girls, but because we couldn't believe that these
girls could produce such a whirling dervish of sound, compounded by
devilish, screeching vocals.   What
re singles, a track for a Shonen Knife
tribute compilation LP (three girls from Japan, no less!), and
their first LPjSpanking Machine on Twin/Tone recoids. Things
were certainly looking up for our Mid-Western heroines.
Spanking Machine, an album of pure aggression, soon caught the eyes and ears of not only North
America, but our English neighbors, and,
quently it was off to Europe to spread the "Babe-
mania" overseas. The English press had a field
day  with them and the moniker of "fox-
core" (penned by Sonic Youth muff-shagger
Thurston Moore) was rampant in every music
tabloid across the Atlantic. At first the Babes
themselves were awestruck at this sudden
adoration, but now feelings have been gradually toned down. In arecent interview with
Lori and Michelle, Michelle had this to
say:"It's really weird there, they're really
fickle in terms of music. One minute it's
something huge, the nex
nothing." And about the "foxcore" h
bel, Michelle is very quick to point oui
that "it was all a joke." However the
sudden increase of female bands
the country has them
very excited. Lori says,"I
think it's great. The
do it, the less people will just talk aboi
Michelle adds: " There's room for all of them.
It doesn't mean they have to compete with one
another, and it doesn't mean they have to be
ipared to each other, they're just in it for
people to listen to."
Of course a little admiration goes a
long way and in late 1990, John Loder of
Southern Studios in London was busily
recording Babes In Toyland's next LP, To
Mother, as well as the infamous John Peel
I    sessions. To Mother shows quite a pro-
ression from their first, especially in
:erms of Kat's vocals-which have gone
from utter rage to dynamic, almost
poetic tones.   The subject matter is
still the same, but as I was told, is
something Kat has great pride in
portraying her lyrics are left to the
imagination to decipher.
Touring continued forthe
rest of 1990 and the better part of
1991, and by this time they had
become veterans of the road: surviving earthquakes and numer-
car accidents, one of which resulted in
becoming the coverof their Insipid single, "Handsome and
Gretel'7'Pearl". Lori relates the origin of the cover:"We
accident in Arizona, and the van got totalled.
I decided to take a picture of Kat right after the accident and
the back cover is of me from an incident that happened about
six or seven years ago."
DISC°0RflPHY
Luckily they survived, for if they hadn't, their deal with
__major label big-wigs Warner Bros, would not have been
struck. "They signed us right after To Mother
is released," says Michelle,
fc<^       "They liked us and
with Twin/Tor
to fulfill, so we decided to wait to record
something for Warner Bros." Lori adds, "It had been a year
since they'd seen us. Our A&R guy was actually coming out
ofthe rain in New York city and the place where he jumped
into to dry himself off was where we were playing. He heard
us and liked it, so it j ust took a year before we actually signed
the deal."
So it's now 1992, and once again Babes In Toyland find
themselves on the road. When this interview was done,
Vancouver was the fourth night of a six-week tour which
found them travelling down the West coast and meeting up
with My Bloody Valentine (of whom they are fans) in San
Francisco, into Texas with Dinosaur Jr., and ending with all
three bands completing the tour together. After which recording ofthe Warner Bros. LP will begin with Minneapolis native
Brian Poulson(sic) and Sonic Youth's Lee Renaldo behind
the knobs and then a return trip to Europe will follow. On the
homefront, Lori has started her own record label, Spanish Fly
Records, in order to increase awareness of other Minneapolis
bands, two of which, Milk and Dumpster Juice, will have 7
inchers out by the time you read this. If you want more info on
this or you just want to profess your love and devotion to

Flywheel and TRUK have been ripping up the airwaves. Tunein Thursday lOish for local live bands.
Also there will be a Discorder
in the summer that is PURELY LOCAL. Theentireissuewilldevotedto
our beautiful local scene! So there's
something to look forward to.
On the evening of March 19 I was
fortunate enough to catch Caustic
Thought at the Cruel Elephant. Raging, hardcore heavy metal happened
at The Cruel on this night. The band
was fully into the tunes that the bands
were handing out and lots of long
hair flew.
Our Testicles Touch the Ground
One of the guys in this band is Justice's friend, and her sister had a
child with a man who is now Justice's roomate, isn't it a small world?

Cat's Game 7" Single
Box 42054, Van B.C. V6T 656 Best
stuff this month. Fast, talented, love-
able punk rock. Check them out live
if at all possible.
Starboys-fte/c/r and Rule
Do the Starboys have homo-erotic
fixations or are the"Death to..." listings and assorted gooey, hate smears
on the back cover purely rhetorical?
In any case, kinda funny the first
time. Grunted vocals overtop strictly hohumsville, retread rock. Doesn't
exactly replicate a fine firm burrito.
Tired stuff. I guess "Van Spec" can
be added to the list of "Fags" wished
death upon on their next release, if
we're so fortunate.
Stick Monkey
A chick sings, right on! However,
after a while it gets repetitive. "How
bored can you get," she sings. Pretty
goddam bored. The faster songs are
better and one would expect more
from this band of ex-Curious George
members.

Can't go wrong with a name like

bass. They are summed up in one
word: alterno-metal.

This tape does not lend itself to boredom avoidance, though this band is
occasionally swell (swollen?) in hve
situations. The intersong snippets
between two seemingly chugged and/
or just fucked up types are by far the
most interesting bits here.

I can't beUeve it's April already!
How time flies! Anyway, here is this
month's edition of "Future Rap."
Prince of Darkness is the title
of Big Daddy Kane's latest. On
this fifteen track release il sounds
Uke BDK's raw hip-hop style has
changed dramaticaUy: now plenty
of singing and R&B is scattered
throughout the tunes. Of course the
braggin' and boastin' still appear
throughout the CD, as weUas Kane's
smoove flowin' lyrics. If it weren't
for women I don't know what kind
of music BDK would do—a lot of
his songs are aimed at pleasing the
female gender. In "The Lover In
You," Prince's "Poplife" is sampled
and used as the basic loop for the
majority of the song. The message
delivered here is toward the fellas,
teUin' them lo treat the ladies with
respect, "We gotta give the women
what they need," as Al B. Sure helps
out in the background vocals wilh a
soft chorus.
Big Daddy Kane introduces
his brother, Little Daddy Shane, in
"Brother, Brother" where the two
show that unity and peace between
each other is how it should be. The
tracks are well produced, the sound
crisp and clear with funky rhythms,
but the singing sort of ruins the songs.
There's no doubt this man is smoove
and can flow wilh plenty of creative,
original lyrics (which might just
make up for the sappy, weak, R&B
choruses). I dunno. "Gel Bizzy" is a
pretty funky jam with a piano introduction and some symbols shakin'
loo! There's a remix of "Raw" renamed "Raw '91" which is not as
good as the original but is sliU alright.
Q-Tip and a ruffneck named
Busta Rhymes appear on "Come On
Down." The song that I find quite
cool is not by Big Daddy Kane but
It's by Mister Cee, his DJ. "DJs Get
No Credit," lets Mister Cee vent his
frustrations. He complains of how
he's takin' for granted and how Big
Daddy Kane should treat him with
more respect, "cause while Kane's
runnin' around havin' all the fun,
MisterCee'sbustin' his ass lomake
everything work! Truth is, Mister
Cee sounds reaUy pissed off.
Oh, I almost forgot... the ru-
mourthat Big Daddy Kanehas AIDS
is a he. He says, that it was started in
his own neighbourhood; it's just a
Yo! Straight outta Washington State is none other lhan Sir Mix-
A-Lot. This brother has his own set
style. The CD's caUed Mack Daddy
fresh for 1992! "Baby Gol Back" is
sure to raise a few eyebrows, and a
Utile controversy. This song is saying that skinny girls wilh no booty
are not in! This man likes big butts,
not flat butts! "Swap Meet Louie" is
a hilarious tale told about ihe fake
apparel sold at swap meets, and ihe
"No return, no refund" policy! I"hc
whole CD- 13 tracks—is slammin'!
I just have four words lo leave you
with... "The Boss Is Back!"
Lord Finesse is back on the
rap scene with his release Return of
Ihe Funky Man on Giant Records/
Warner Brothers. Homs, symbols,
and broken guitar chords (and of
course the basshne) help create this
lord's funky atmosphere. One issue
dropped deals with the ladies and
how after Lord Finesse became well
known and recognized as a rapslar.
;s that at first dissed his e;
ence now come runnin' up. Typical... at first ignored him but now are
hawkin'. What does the Funky Man
have to say to these trippin' females?
The answer can be found in "Save
That Shil." Get the picture? This lil'
shorty kicks the crazy flavour, with
raw beats and a lot of bad-assed
braggin'. After listening to this CD a
buncha times it seems that Lord Finesse has a lot of bitterness and resentment towards a lol of people.
This is confirmed in such songs as
"Hey Look at Shorty," and "Fuck
'Em." Return to the Funky Man
seems to tell many true tales of how
people act towards others. Sad but
true... there's far too many jealous
fools out there who lose sight of
reaUty and act a fool. It's a damn
shame when there's no reason for
such cruelty and stupidity. Thai's
alright, what comes around goes
around.
Sir Mix-A-Lot scores as rapper of the month. It's good to see that
thisbro' from Seattle can reaUy throw
down!
Later Man!

Open 7 Days a Week Good day, children of Vancouver!
My name is Grant and I am still
writing the 7" column. Let me start
off this month with a recent, and sad,
experience of mine:
A couple of days ago I was putting up posters for a rock show. As
most of you who are in bands know,
postering is extremely competitive
and I, for one, count on stores putting
posters up in windows where ass-
hole-bands can't get lo them. I walked
into a bookstore who has been putting up our posters for years and
kindly asked the guy to put up the
poster. Hesitantly he took it and
looked it over. "What kind of music
is it?" he asked. "Rock and roll," I
replied. He handed back the poster
and said "Sorry, we aren't putting
those up anymore. Anything but rock
and roll." Disgusted and shocked I
said to him "I never thought that I
would hear the day someone said to
me 'anything but rock and roll.'"
Then he lashed back "Rock and roll
stopped being progressive years
ago." I lost my temper and screamed,
"Because of square assholes like
you!" Then he told me to get out. I
fingered him and left. The book store
is on the NE corner of Pender and
Richards.
The firsl single under review is a
punch to that fuck-head's nuts. They
just released a two song diamond on
Lance Rock records of Vancouver
and they are Bum. Hailing from Pop-
town Canada (Victoria) Bum are the
best group I have heard and seen in
ages. Live they put on an incredible
show and what a toaster this new
single is. The music is straight ahead
bashin', smashin', power-popin',
punkin' rock and roll with audible
influences ranging from Bad Religion to the Kingsmen, with a bit of
Alice Cooper and the Ramones
thrown in. This is a great slab of
vinyl from a fantastic new band.
Bands like Bum not only push the
bounds of rock and roll ahead, they
steamroll right over the top of the
idiotic and naive "rock and roll is
dead" mentality.
YAHOOO! A local release! Ust
month I was bitching about no local
releases on vinyl and voila, a local
single by one of Vancouver's best:
Cat's Game, released on CSFU's
Three Minute Mile Records. This is
TMM's second release (thefirst was
Dirt in 1990) and I salute them for
continuing the label, especially with
such a great, original band as Cat's
Game. Though very cheaply made
and very limited (only 300 copies), this chunk still delivers the
goods first class. The recordings
are not stellar but the songs rock.
Pure hardcore with airs of humour, discontent and out and out
rage. The two songs are both
good with the B-side "Home
Sweet Home" being my fave of
the two. It blazes. Congratulations
Cat's Game on your first vinyl
release. Stick to it and make us
Just in from Eastern Canada is a
new 7" from Toronto's legendary
Ten Commandments. These
guys have been around for a long,
long time and have been consis-
tantly over-looked, yet have maintained a constant stream of vinyl
releases for almost a decade. The
latest is an extremely limited (200
copies of blue vinyl) release of a
couple o' power pop rockers. The
A-side, "Revolution Man" is a
really great song reminding me of
a Soft Boys meets a paced down
Buzzcocks type of sound. The B-
side, "Dark Angel" is a brooding
rocker reminiscent of another great
Canadian band Color Me Psycho.
Keep it up Ten Commandments.
Speaking of Robyn Hitchcock, I
ran across a really cool single by a
band I really know nothing about.
The single "Gun"b/wR Hitchcock's
"I Wanna Destroy You" is by a group
called Uncle Tupelo. It's a great
find, both songs are really amazing
angst-fueled-by-emotion rock
songs.'T Wanna Destroy You"is my
favourite song of the month. The
record is on the Rockville label and
I will certainly be looking for more
Uncle Tupelo soon.
And now foranotherinstallment
of "Portland Now!" What's going
on down there? More bands, more
great singles! This month I was fortunate enough to find two releases
on IMP Records. The firsl is Jack-
knife's "Stuck Up Art Bitch" b/w
"Rat Top Fucker." Yes, it's certainly a very sexist little project bul
being one lo wantonly overlook sexism I thoroughly enjoyed this record.
It's poorly recorded but that's OK,
the songs are slam bam dirgey rock
and roll numbers virging on psycho-
billy. "Stuck Up Art Bitch" is great.
I'm glad somebody finally yelled
that oul, even if it is a girl singer.
The other new IMP release is
from Oswald 5-0, yet another great
Oregonian band. If I'm not mistaken
these folks are from Eugene, and
man, that town should be proud of
the Oswalds. The single, "Eraser" b/
w "Felony Flats" is a very hep 7".
Both songs are way cool punk rock
filled with hooks and choruses that
I'm really starting to love. I wasn't
expecting to like either of these so it
was a nice surprise.
And of course no 7" column
would be complete without a review
of a release from the greatest single
label around, Sympathy For the
Music Industry. This month they
released a true treasure: A Mum-
mies/Woifmen double 7" pack;
complete with an eight page colour
comic book and full colour cover by
surf maniac-artiste. Coop! Whew! It
is a fantastic example of pure 7"
enjoyment (vinyl enjoyment that is...
). Besides the great cover and awe-
inspiring comic book, The Mummies rip-it-up—punk rock a la '66
via the classics "Land of 1000 dances" and "Victim Of Circumstances."
It's pretty stupid these guys broke up
for they simply put out some ofthe
most rockin' music around. Look
for a compilation LP of all their stuff
on Estrus. The Wolfmen I had never
heard of until this single, and though
not as good as the Mummies, in any
regard they still shake it up with the
fervent, rockabilly, 50's trash style
of songs "Insane in an Insane World"
and "I Don't Want No One." Neato
Shit.
And while we're on the topic of
shit, let's take a gander Seattle ways
and see what's new with Sub Pop.
One recent release was a split single
featuring two east coast US bands.
Tsunami and Velocity Girl. Both
these bands are along the lines of the
K/ Beat Happening "crash pop" styl-
ings. In the summer I saw Tsunami
at the International Pop Underground
Convention and thought of them live
much the same as I do of this record:
mushy and undefined. It can be compared to the whole Teenage Fanclub
/Don Fleming "soft n' fuzzy" feel
but on this platter it just doesn't cut
it. Velocity Girl sound so much like
Tsunami I could hardly tell the difference! Cute, bubble gum naive
cover but over all a boring record.
The Monkeywrench, on the
other hand, is something very different. When I first heard this record I
hated it. I was so excited when I
bought it, expecting to hear some
wild rave-up garage and punk rock,
seeing as it featured some of Seattle's true marksmen of garage and
punk rock—Mudhoney's Mark Arm
and Steve Turner, and Gashuffer's
Tom Price. But when I played the
record what I got was some fucked
up bluesy shit. Disgusted, I ripped
the single off the turntable and
chucked in a comer. Weeks later, in
fact yesterday, I was listening to
CiTR while driving and heard this
real cool slide guitar tune. Then to
my surprise I realized it was "Bottled Up and Go," the A-side of the
Monkeywrench single. "Was this
the same single," I asked myself in
disbelief...? Nonetheless, when I got
home I brushed the dead flies and
dog hair off the single and let her fly
onceagain. Whaddayaknow.Iloved
il! Crazy, warped bluesy stuff. Great
guitars, from the slide stuff on "Bottled Up and Go" to the superfuzz on
"Out of Focus" this is a damn fine
little record. I guess I was just expecting what would be predictable
from these      pi_d lh_ following local bands m ^ jumble ^low ,

Joe. These guys have just released
an album on Popllama and this baby
is the single for that rekkid. The A-
side is entitled "Love Plumbin'," the
B-side'TWant Some Bud.'Tor those
of you who are not familiar with
Stumpy Joe let me tell you they are
a band that revolves around substance abuse. Most of the songs are
about drinkin', smokin', or fuckin'
and these two ditties are no different.
Stumpy Joe rock. Their songs are
hard driving anthems that slam-bang
their way from sun to finish. Personally, I preferred their first single
on Estrus to this one. Though still
great this single doesn't quite reach
the height of excellence the first
achieved. Also, I really hate drugs so
I couldn't get into "I Want Some
Bud" too much, even if it is built
around a Sonics' riff.
So that's that Thanks for reading
this far and I hope I'm doing an OK job
at this. CITR gets tons of singles each
month and of course I can only review
so many. If you want yer single reviewed here for sure send it to CiTR/
Discorder with my name, Grant Lawrence, on it and I'll be sure to write
something about it. KEEP THOSE
LOCAL RECORDS COMING!!!
(Note: last month I said Zipgun were
"really fine PUNK"nafunk! That was
a typing error! I HATE FUNK!!!).
[Sorry, Grant Good thing we didnt
print junk. Ed.]
when I got
something

rejected it.

iOos$ sadvi iosiv • Hoivuos no 'hovhi 'mnz IV HO Robyn Hitchcock and the
Egyptians
86 Street Music Hall
Friday 21 February
Okay, okay, I can come out of
the musical closet and freely
admit that I have a liking for
wimpy British pop bands, and
Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians has to be one of my faves.
I have actually caught him
beforein a solo performance at
the illustrious Tom Lee Music
Hall, and found him to be extremely quirky as he tells the
most surreal tall tales you'll
hear, guaranteed. So, I was quite
interested to see how he performed with the Egyptians, and
he rocked.. .Well, maybe rocked
isn't the right term for Robyn
Hitchcock but the Egyptians
certainly were tight.
The emphasis was on tunes
from their latest, Perspex Island . Hitchcock kept the between song patter to a minimum and instead concentrated
on his music. Music that is undeniably pop, but in the best
sense of the word—full of unexpected shifts and, of course,
the well known wacky lyrics.
The melancholy feel of "Glass
Hotel" gave me goose bumps
and it was cool to hear "Clean
Steve" on piano. I still like
Robyn Hitchcock even if he
didn't do "Madonna of the
Wasps."

Superconductor
Sludge
Cats and Dogs
Tuesday 25 February
Club Soda
Seattle's Cats and Dogs opened
the night boasting that they were
the "next big thing" on the Seattle scene,but hey, talk is
cheap. All I heard was a lot of
generic rock fronted by a Sebastian Bach-lookalike-
.Takeanumber, boys.
Thankfully, the pride of
Port Coquitlam, Sludge, lifted
my spirits— yet not without
some struggle. This was the
first time I had seen Sludge
live and it was hard for me to
believe that they had a generous following behind them.
Y'see, their Melvins-y grind
was endurable at times but after a while I felt like I had
fallen into a huge vat of Aunt
Jemima syrup. Maybe with a
bit more practice and creativity Sludge could become the
shining stars of tommorrow.
However,if you like them now,
you can find their two locally
released cassettes at finer rek-
kid stores everywhere.
From the opening chords
of "Most Popular Man In The
World," it became apparent
that Superconductor were out
to dump the relatively despondent crowd on its collective
butt with sheer heaviness and
volume. Past shows have seen
'Conductor erupt as an unde-
finable barrage of noise but
with Club Soda's sound this
was by far the most controlled
mess I'd ever heard. As well as
great sound, Club Soda boasts
a stage that can actually contain these rambunctious and
young riff-lords, with one
lucky member getting half the
stage all to himself. [As well
as "Most Popular..," other
highlights of Superconductor's
bone-crushing set included
"Flash," "Murderlizer,"
"Despair,"a classic cover of
E.L.O.'s "Do Ya," and an ultra-heavy version of Donovan's "Colors" (which will
appear on an upcoming Donovan covers compilation on
Nettwerk Records).
Just when I thought it was
over and I had lost my breath
due to lengthy screams of approval, they blew the roof off
of the joint with a tune known
only as "Riff." The stage became     host     to     hurling
bodies.massive feedback, and
otherwise complete mayhem.
After the smoke cleared and the
feedback stopped I thrust my
fist in the air and worshipped
the new kings of noise-
rock...they are Superconductor.
So if you're thinking of buying
that new Nirvana bootleg album, save your mone chump
and get the debut CD of Superconductor's Heavy with Puppy
on Boner Records instead. You
and your pals won't be sorry.

Club Soda Farewell Show
20 Bands
Thursday 27 February
Is it mere coincidence that club
regulars Motley Crue collapsed
the same week Club Poser died?
Hmm. Two days after Superconductor did the wallbreaking-
ly cool Soda show, twenty bands
played in one night. The place
was sardine packed.needless to
say.
Until about 12:30, there
were too many bands I had never seen and none stuck out except Joker's Wild (I think
they stole Tomcat's singer). They were okay, and
garage thrashband Decadence were less crappy
than in the past as well
three-piece, In the Flesh
were passable which was
surprising s ince their g ui -
tarist has a hit on him for
indiscretions with the
spouse of a prominent
gangland figure.
Skids N Rowses
fakers, Nemisis Gypsy
were memorable only in
the fact that they had their
name on the drum head
and that a Nardwuar
lookalike plays for them.
Unfortunately, next up
was Piss Piss n Wank,
whose accurate rep for
pompous pretension and
boredom precedes them.
Finally, well respected moshmakers
Caustic Thought were
on. Caustic Thought are
extremely enjoyable for
their straight ahead power and choosing not to
over rushi or overclutter
their thrash metal vigor.
Next was the grow-
ingly popular Vertical
After (notorious for rushing and cluttering) who
sent the crowd wild with
one heavy original and ariproar-
ing cover of "Ace of Spades."It
had reached two AM with one
band left to play; then creative,
new, three piece Grey Skies finished the night with some tasty
tunes until the lights came on
and the plug was pulled. THE
END.

Soundgarden
The Melvins
The Commodore Ballroom
Wednesday 4 March
Whoa Mom it's The Melvins.
Acoupleof years ago, The
Melvins printed up a few thousand tour shirts that said "Louder than Soundgarden" and then
sold them to their rockstar
friends. That's why you see L7
wearing them in every photo
ever taken and Dave Novosel-
ic, bassist for Nirvana, sporting it for the nation on Saturday Night Live. Believe me,
this did/does not harm their
career; nor does having the
opening spot for Soundgarden
on a few local region gigs.
Louder than Soundgarden
they were and increasingly hypnotic was their drink. Like lis
tening to Helmet on Ritalin cov
ering Godflesh, with the loom
ing danger that the stacks be
hind them are kegs of dyna
mite ready to explode on ;
whim. They play with the
quirky syncopation of a sym
phony orchestra under rigor
ing board and voila, but few
can have total control of that
wattage and use it like an instrument.
This is where Soundgarden failed. Yeah, they were
"louder than fuck," but Sound-
garden could use a li ttle schooling on the simple formula that
overly loud = distortion. In all
honesty, this is the first gig that
I've seen at the Commodore
Ballroom where the sound was
so inaudible you were left
guessing at what song they were
playing. Kind of reminded me
of a Test Dept show.
Well, if that wasn'tenough
I had to deal with drunk and
disorderly Surrey refugees
wearing Danzig t-shirts and
slobbering "Have they played
'Jesus Christ Pose' yet?" Pathetic. I can only thank Perryscope productions graciously
for not advertising the gig because the Surrey populace
would have been in full force if
they had.
From the beginning the
crowd was frantic and pitched
ous command. Up to this point
I thought the Melvins were the
most over-rated indie band
around, well they still are (as
far as vinyl goes) but they sure
aren't when it comes to the live
performance. A lot of bands
can be loud, that's easy with a
simple turn on the amp or mix-
themselves into the Chris Cornell shrine as Chris Cornell
pitched himself into the grunge-
hungry crowd during "Search-
in' With My Good Eye Closed."
Followed up with "Loud Love,"
from their same-titled first A &
M release the band seemed to
be at home despite the lengthy
hiatus since they last payed our
fair city a visit on a bill that
sported Voivod and Faith No
About halfway through
their performance Kim Thayil
(guitar) and Ben Shepherd
(bass) left the stage to Chris
and Matt (drums) for a somewhat solo (read lame) rendition of my (used to be) favorite song from Badmotorfinger
, "Mind Riot." Granted Chris
has amazing vocal talents, he's
a hack when it comes to playing the guitar. Fortunately, for
us all, he only took to the 6
string beast a few times during the concert and let the musicians in the band do the job
for which they were getting
paid.
After a trip through
Soundgarden's buffet—
ncluding a lesson in crowd
control from my co-host's girlfriend (a petite and genteel 5'
stick of dynamite who was
throwing around guys 3X her
mass), the band paid their respects to fellow Seattlers Pearl
Jam with an "Alive"/"Inces-
sant Mace" medley and
left fhe stage.
We couldn'task for
more, they gave us everything they had, except for maybe a few
tickets to the sold out
shows at Seattle's Para-
Die Kreuzen
Caustic Thought
Town Pump
Friday 6 March
Only two nights after the
horrendous affair of
having to deal with Surrey Soundgarden fans
came the unfortunate
dealings at the Die
Kreuzen Benefit For
Back-Ass Suburban (insert your favorite suburb: Delta, Surrey...)
Fucks. Well, it should
have been a benefit 'cuz
hopefully they could
have raised enough
money to build a huge
moat, or erect a 70 foot
electric fence, or something, to keep these narrow-minded shits from
infesting Vancouver
again. I'm sure you're
more than familiar with
the people I'm talking
about; the ones so igno-
rantly narrow-minded you can
hear a distinct whistle from
between their ears when the
wind picks up. The ones who
dismiss anything that doesn't
sound like All or Dead
Kennedys as not being "hardcore."
Well, Die Kreuzen don't
sound like All and they don't
APRIL Q) sound like Dead Kennedys;
they don't sound like anybody.
They sound like Die Kreuzen.
Die Kreuzen are a prototype.
For well over 10 years this
Milwaukee foursome have
been spinning their own illustrious web of "prog-core"
which goes way beyond the
innovative likes of...um? The
whole scene is so homogenized
right now that it's impossible
tocompare Die Kreuzen to anybody else. What they're doing
is so different from the mainstream of alternative that wc
have to put up with people like
the demi-skatcr, poseur hardcore boy. There's one at every
show isn't there?
To elaborate a little, some
people don't like it because
they don' t understand il; a common trend.
For the few, but appreciative. Die Kreuzen fans in attendance the show was a steady
stream of atmospheric entrap-
ments. Dan, with his unique
and piercing vocal attributes,
led all believers into a euphoric haven while Eric, Keith and
Brian—the other Die Kreuzen
disciples—wrestled for apiece
of our faith. The band came
bearing gifts including old
gems such as "Counting
Cracks," "Man In The Trees"
and "Elizabeth," plus the new
Commandments of Cement.
With the inclusion of the bliss-
30 ji^goQTjga
ful "Gone Away" and an encore of Wire's "Pink
Flag"(which they've released
on 7" b/w a cover of the Germs'
"Big Bad Days"), Die Kreuzen
drenched us in the fruits of a
mutual labour.
I guess you could say that
seeing Die Kreuzen live is a
religious experience; hopefully the few non-believers have
seen the light and can choose to
pray to the newly-baptized
prog-core God!
Scooter
Nitzer Ebb
The Commodore Ballroom
Saturday 7 March
Having heard a bit of their latest, Ebbhead , 1 was worried
that Nitzer Ebb was going to be
a Depeche Mode clone. Thankfully, I needn't have worried.
They certainly sounded a
lot harder than I expected, even
though my friend cynically noticed that the percussionist's
hitting of his drum didn't always match the music. But
when a band plays for almost
two hours you can'treally complain too loudly.
Like at Front 242, but even
more so, the crowd acted like
they were in the presence of a
hardcore band and not a wimpy
electronic band. Even yours truly, who unwisely wore dinky
little runners, got into the fray
and got some righteous bruises.
Most people were too busy
having fun to really notice that
the band were high-energy, but
nothing spectacular. The middle part of the show did drag a
tad, as they played newer, unfamiliar stuff, but they did all
the songs that people in the
audience were expecting to
hear: "Lightning Man," "Control I'm Here," and "Fun to Be
Had." Tons o' fun was had.

Mr. Bungle
Grotus
86 Street Music Hall
Saturday 14 March
Hopefully (for your sake)
you're reading this as a reminder of what a great time you had
on Saturday and not because
you didn't see the show. But
for all you fools who were silly
enough to stay home, wash your
llama, make long distance calls
to spuzzum etc., then you
should jump into that whirlpool of regret right about now.
San Franciscans Grotus
utilized a fashionable red theme
in their ensemble and pum-
mcled those attending with
hypnotic images displayed
upon a T V. Grotus came across
as very authentic and, via chats
with members Bruce and
Adam, I learned that they were
extremely appreciative of this
touring opportunity. Although
I'd prepared them for an un-
enthused audience, Grotus
lured people with their warped
yet accessible sound. As far as
I'm concerned, any band that
can make the theme song of
Entertainment Tonight part of
their set will always get kudos
T'was nuthin' but Bungle
fever once Grotus had done
their damage. Perhaps half the
people there just wanted to see
Mike Patton, of Faith No More
fame, in the flesh. This was the
first night of the tour. In fact, it
was Mr. Bungle's first tour
ever. Yet the show wasn't just
hormones running amuck or
mere attempts at weirdness.
Mike's voice was in impeccable form considering the entire
band played the entire show in
a wide variety of seemingly
suffocating masks.
Mr. Bungle impeccably
recreated songs off their album with lots of new twists,
time changes etc. and stage
divers were in an annoying
abundance. Yet our heroic
singer took joy in using them
as objects of innocent abuse—
one lucky sucker got his head
used as a makeshift drum pedal. Mike's climbing of theraun-
chy, oversized guitar beside the
stage was regarded with pleasure as feet and various other
appendages thrashed in a sea
of euphoria. Mr. Bungle succeeded in bringing 86 Street to
it's feet and raising eyebrows
in poetic confusion. Isn't it nice
to know that there are people
out there just as twisted as you?
Emma
Monomen
American Soul Spiders
Super Snazz
Bellingham Bay Brewing
Co.
Saturday 14 March
What better way to celebrate
friend, had to walk the couple
of blocks to the already legendary Northwest venue. In the
short year that this club has
been open it's played host to an
assortment of largely reknown
independent bands and, on the
night in mention, to the first
wave of the coming (I'm officially predicting this) Japanese
invasion.
The invasion has been
looming on the horizon, just
past the setting sun, for quite
awhile now but since the just-
add-water success of Nirvana
the ears of North America have
been readied for the mutant take
on American music by our
friends across the big blue. Nirvana plays into this simply by
being the international promoters for Shonen Knife. It's in
vogue right now to be influenced by Shonen Knife (as witnessed by the diverse amount
of talent on last year's Every
Band Has A Shonen Knife Who
Loves Them tribute) as it is to
be listening to Nirvana and
thankfully Super Snazz and
A.S.S. sound nothing like Shonen Knife. The world has heard
enough from The Andrews Sisters, thanks.
But I digress.
If you are not a regular to
the Bellingham Bay Brewing
Co. then you are sadly missing
out—as I have for the past year!
The 3-B has the decor of a struggling art students loft and the
feel/buzz of the Old Cruel Elephant. Although a stranger to
the place I felt as though I had
been there numerous times before, and I felt comfortable in
the place, not intimidated; like
in so many Vancouver clubs
with people and their cliques in
attendance to better one another. With the winning combination of alternative-oriented
my inaugral visit to the 3-B
then with the two opening acts
coming all the way from Japan
for tlie event. Actually, it was
more coincidence that Super -
Snazz and American Soul Spiders were present on the first
opportunity that I, and my recently turned 21 year old girl-
bookings and the mere S5.00
(U.S.) price tag for a LARGE
pitcher of Weinhard's this club
kicks the ass of a lot of Northwest region clubs. If that isn't
enough things start EARLY and
on time.
So, the first band to take to
thenot-a-bad-seat-in-thc-house
stage was Super Snazz. These
are four women who can kick
the ass, pull the hair and scratch
the eyes out of Hole, Dickless,
Babes In Toyland and L7 all at
once. On top of that they were
attractive, unlike the above
mentioned bands—with the exception of Kat from Babes. But
beauty does not a band make
and although the lead singer
won a few patriotic hearts by
donning a lycra, American flag
skirt their music and love for it
could have carried them alone.
Super Snazz are best summed
up as a cross between Sonic
Youth andTheGruesomes, and
are simply the best, much needed, twist on the foxcore scheme
of things to come along. Their
set was full of ladies who definitely enjoy their work and
saw it as fun and not the burden
that so many bands make it out
to be today as they seek a major label deal.
The American Soul Spiders, who followed, were the
make equivalent to Super
Snazz but played with the testosterone frenzy that Super
Snazz could not match (but believe me those ladies sure did
try!). The first visual comparison was how the guitar player
looked, uncannily, like Marky
Ramone: skinny, hairdo, same
playing technique; I actually
had to get a closer look at the
fellow to prove myself wrong.
The second visual comparison was how much the vocalist looked like Axl Rose—
but don't hold that against him.
A.S.S. strayed far, but not too
far, away from the metal pigeonhole they could so easily
have been lumped into with
customized versions of "Satisfaction," "I Wanna Be Your
Dog" and a G.G. Allin tune. I
say customized version because A.S.S. seems to be aband
who have been weened on
American rock circa Stooges
and MC5. Now take those influences and throw in the obvious hindrance of not being
raised in North America where
the tunes ofthe aforementioned
were readily available, add the
timid nature of The Japanese
and you have the music that
Iggy and The Stooges would
be playing today were they still
around.
If disco, whynotpre-punk
Detroit metal?
Ah, but all good things
come to an end and this was the
case when Bellingam's own
Monomen took to the stage. I
wouldn't hate these guys if the
large guitarist didn't have so
much of a Rock-God attitude:
"Can I get more sustain on the
guitar?" I left. Come to think
of it, I would still hate them.
Paul T. Brooks Spalding Gray
Vancouver East Cultural
Centre
March 17-22
opening night
It was the best Saint Patrick's
Day ever! Well, aside from
second grade when I wore all
green from head-to-toe and
felt total little-kid-bliss.
Spalding Gray began his
six night run at the Cultch
with a brief intro blending
into a soliloquy on movie
mecca El-Lay, Therapy, Nicaragua, the Moscow film festival, his mother's suicide.
Existentialism vs Christian
Science (which is better), how
to sneak drinks, AIDS and
much more. The man just did
not let up. The "show" is all
true; Spalding gets inspiration from his daily observations. The Monster in a Box
is the book which Gray was
comissioned to write and almost never finished; finally
at 1800+ pages the book is
ready for, um, editing.
This was performance
art at it's best. For 90 minutes
Spalding addressed us as one
with his rambling "New England" accent not often heard
in these parts. He sat at a
wooden desk with the microphone, a glass of water and
the "Monster." His words
were hilarious and at times
disturbing (his mother/son relationship was rather dysfunctional, shall we say). If you
missed the show you can catch
the movie which features music by Laurie Anderson, coming this summer. The monologue is also available in
paperback...funny, if it were
anyone else this would all
seem so "commercial" (ie.
see, read, buy) but it doesn't
at all.
In terms of celebrity,
Spalding is not a capital "C"
and can therefore appreciate
seeing the movie star pecking
order in full swing as recounted in his memoirs of his trip to
Moscow with Matt Dillon, Richard Gere, et al for a film
fest (he was there showing his
Swimming to Cambodia). And
how about the time the suicide hotline folks suggested
counselling after an interview
to help answer calls? Or when
he was hit with an AIDS scare
(he had fallen for, in his words,
a"stage-door-judy") when his
girlfriend developed an unrelated rash. Part of the fun of
seeing Spalding comes from
his neuroses, which though not
exactly exploited for his art,
are not kept hidden either. Really, he's a lot like you and
me...if we had the nerve.

The Cramps
Dash Rip Rock
Commodore Ballroom
Wednesday 18 March
Lux Interior isn'tcircumsized.
That's a review in itself, but
we'll talk about Lux's dick later. First, the show.
Dash Rip Rock opened
for the Cramps. If I'd downed
a mickey of Jack Daniels on
the way to the Commodore,
perhaps these guys would have
come off a little better. I'm
straight-edge, so I didn't. As a
result, the Rip Rockers struck
me as an energetic southern
rock band with Lynyrd
Skynyrd influences and Beat
Farmer aspirations who do the
worst on-stage comedy routines since Rich Little. Pretty
fun musically, but that schtick
was painful. I winced.
I winced at the Cramps
too, but like I said, we'll talk
about Lux' dick later.
The Cramps, on this particular night, were just the
Cramps and that was good
enough. They had their look
do wn pat: abassistwho couldn't
beat a pencil in a body building
contest and was good for arousing game of guess the gender (it
was a man for those who wagered); a Gene Vincent ripoff
who kept smoking two cigarettes at once behind the drum
kit; Poison Ivy belting out antiquated licks from her great big
Gretsch and looking like she
belonged in a wax museum, and
Lux smashing mic stands and
sweating profusely while lending substance to the rumour that
he and Iggy Pop are the same
person.
And boy did that look drive
the crowd into a frenzy. It's
weird how those accountant-
by-day types are the first to
supriseyou with their rabid dedication to a band like the
Cramps. Yeah, the crowd really got into this one, which always makes for an enjoyable
show in my estimation. You
know, high energy level and all
that. And while they may have
been disappointed by the fact
that most of the material came
from the Cramps' last two albums, the inclusion of "The
Way I Walk," "The Crusher,"
"Domino," "Goo Goo Muck"
and other old favorites served
to keep the crowd hopping.
Then there was Lux's dick.
Yep, Lux showed his age when
he showed his dick. He isn't
circumsized, he's not a natural
brunette, and he hasn't seen the
light of day or a weightroom in
his fifty odd years. But that's
OK. It was somehow beautiful
to see ol' Lux singing "Surfin'
Bird" completely in the buff as
red wine rolled down his translucent body. Even Ivy showed
some expression at that one.
And like everything else at the
Cramps show, the crowd just
loved it.
Yeah, it's still true kids.
The Cramps don' t pummel, they
ooze. And on March 18th, the
Commodore crowd didn'tpogo,
they throbbed. Amen.

Sarcastic Mannequins
A Cartoon Swear
Cruel Elephant
Friday 20 March
It's always difficult when you
stick to what you believe in and
don't follow the latest trend.
Sarcastic Mannequins and A
Cartoon Swear were/are the
two Vancouver bands least
likely to get signed to Sub-
Pop, but most likely to make
me want to scream the loudest
and pour the most beer over
my head.
A whimper, or maybe a
weep, always finds itself
bouncing between my ears
when a band who has won my
respect decides to shovel in
the old coffin. The first time
Sarcastic Mannequins made
their imprint on my brain was
at Shindig 1988 at the Railway Club. Those interested in
Vancouver trivia might wonder who these lads, with their
wooden mannequins, defeated in their quest for glory?
Silent Gathering (including
pre-Windwalker and Super-
conducter members).
Guess who had the
cheapest New Year's Party to
harken 1989? The Archimedes
Taxi Driver Club hadn't seen
that many people before, but
the Mannequins and Damage
C'est Damage played an integral role in the construction of
my brain damage for the
evening.
Hey, these guys backed
up Firehose, so they are wailing okay?
Two sets of fantastic renditions of sheet music off their
two scintillating releases.
Don't tell me you don't remember the one with the vol-
vo on the cover? Beez was
even giving out stickers and
pins. I took a sticker 'cause I
didn't have one on my guitar
case. I had to put a sweater on
for all the shivers I was getting off the good Karma of
people who knew the lyrics
and maybe actually believed
in them. Brad, jazz-beat master-drummer, who sways his
head like booze is still illegal,
was tight enough to persuade
a full pit to bop to the ceiling.
Mr. Shyman never seemed to
make a mistake copping his

DEADBEATJTUJS Big Star, a compilation of two Big
Star albums and one Bell solo effort.
Well, all I can say is this: every
few years, some butt-kicking mainstream rock critic looks back twenty
years and decides that one particular
band is responsibleforan entiretrend
in contemporary music. There was
Link Wray, The Velvet Underground, The Seeds and, more recently, MC5 and The Stooges. Now it's
Big Star.
Please enjoy Big Star for what
they are. They write good songs,
usually. Most of those songs are
infused with a good deal of feeling

have strong voices.
Their album is eminently likeable and

LUKA BLOOM
The Acoustic Motorbike
(Warner)
1991 marked the year that Irish musician Luka Bloom returned lo his
homeland afler nearly four years of
working and touring in Canada, ihe
U.S. and Europe. It was during this
year that he rediscovered Dublin and
penned the songs for his sophomore
effort The Acoustic Motorbike . Motorbike is an emotionally naked piece
of work. At times this brooding and
introspective CD's moody traits are
welcomely contrasted by Bloom's
passionate guitar work and strong,
determined vocals.
The firsl track, "Mary Watches Everything," deals wilh the manner in which society learns of world
events ihrough the medium of television. One can't help bul wonder if
Bloom had been listening to Chris
Isaak's Heart Shaped World whilst
setting Ihis one tomusic. The unlikely choice to cover rapper L.L. Cool
J's "I Need Love" works brilliantly,
as does the remake of lil vis' "I Can't
Help Falling Love With You."
Bloom's interpretation helps oneto
forget the putrid translation pouted
out a few years back by (blcch!)
Corey Han. But ihc mosl unforgettable cut by far is the album's title
track, "The Acoustic Motorbike," a
chronicle of Bloom's cycling expeditions through Dublin. Bloom docs
nol so much sing this lunc as he docs
compellingly narrate to il. 'I"hc sounds
of various farm animals sound off in
ihe distance, while Bloom's guitar
races feverishly alongside his driving lyrics.
Best summed up as an acoustic
player's treasure, Motorbike is a
good case in point that, sometimes,
less is more. With the guitar as ils
focal point, Mo/orMe eliminates the
need for heavy inslnimcnlals, and
allows the listener lo enjoy Bloom's
exceptional songwriting talents.

RUMBLE MILITIA
Stop Violence and Madness
(Century Media)
Basically, Slop Violence and Madness by Rumble Militia is typical
thrash-melal. An exception is
"You're Sure"; were they thinking
potential lop-ten hit for this one?
31 [I_^g°__E__*B
Well, ilmight have worked if not for
the obvious rip-off and bass solo
(from "Wild Thing' and "Knockin'
On Heaven's Door" respectively),
and the singer's inability to carry a
tune in the proverbial bucket (you
know, the one that dear Liza still
couldn't fix afler nine verses). Here
is one exception to the rule that good
musicians steal. But, as everyone
knows, you don't have to be a good
musician to play thrash-melal.
Hacki, Staffi and Olli (are these
your real names, guys?), the musicians whocomprise Rumble Militia,
appear to be East European metal-
meislcrs transported to lx>s Angeles
who magically managed lo survive
the trip with their morals intact. Yes,
they have a message, several, in fact.
"You Arc A Reflection of Your Video Programme" warns real life is not
a video; if you kill someone, you
can't rewind the lape and make the
dead come back lo life. "Stop This
Shit" argues against experimentation on animals. "Save Yourself
tells anyone who will listen that war
is bad. "Wailing for Death" is a dirge
aboul the useless pursuits mosl people waste iheir lives on. As for the
title track,"Slop Violence And.Mad-
5," — you figure ii out.
So, ifyou like your metal v
cssage, by all means buy il.

Slar is especially
comfortable.   B.
licve me, Big Star is
not the original incarnation of "The
College Sound."
A Little Big Star is dated. It's
20 years old, OK. The band's primary concern is to sound pretty, which
leads to some pretty irritating Three
Dog Night-like moments. Most important, in my humble opinion, this
type of music needs the energy that
punk sensibilities provide lo be of
any interest. Big Star, without question, lacks those sensibilities.
Sothereyougo. BigStarisjusl

MONOMEN
Wrecker
(Estrus Records)
0 greal. Now there's a Bellingham
Yes, the Monomcn's new LP,
Wrecker, sounds a fair bit like their
Bcllingam brethren, Gas Huffer. Less
inclined towards pop than the I luf fer,
the Monomen have the same idea.
You know, the "we dig music, fuzzy
guitars, party, party, party..." idea. I
could tell lhat was ihe idea by the
the advance copy cover.
So, is this a good idea'.' Well,
yeah,ifyou can rcconcileyourself to
ihe idea that singing about booze all
ihc time is slightly less dumb than
making a point nol lo sing about
booze at all. In other words, I'd rather listen to the Monomen on Saturday nighl than, say, the Smiths. Or
jazz. Or Fugazi [OUCH! Ed.]. Which
isn 'l lo say that a ton o' bands aren 'l
doing the same thing as the
Monomen, only more effectively.
This record jusl lacks hooks. It
is just a little loo straight forward to
of the Slow Moving Choice Award
for the sociologically and politically
"enlightened" of the nineties.
A child of the early punk era,
Rollins avoided the inevitable contradictory failings of all mass movements, even denouncing most of his
so called iconoclast peers and protegees as conservative and narrow
minded, and turned inward in an
often tortuous examination of himself. Some of you may remember his
brutally honest fax interview presented in Discorder a while ago—an
interview in which he discussed his
violent tendencies, his inability to
love, and his promotion of sexual
gratification. The roots of these
things, he hinted al, wa.s a childhood
of neglect and abuse, and a society
which treats young men like him
wilh suspicion and hostility.
Now, you may wonder what a
muscle-bound, tattooed, screaming
behemoth, who looks like he could
have the bcller of it with a T-72, is
doing singing songs about self-esteem, loneliness, and depression?
Ihis is precisely the point. Whether
it is in the lyrics of his songs or in his
spoken monologues, Mr. Rollins
demonstrates, his sensitivity and
thoughtfulness with articulate sentiments of alienation, confusion, and
blinding rage directed al a world
which refuses to care or even begin
to understand.
His latest collection. The End
Of Silence is no exception. Beginning with a track entitled "Low Self
Opinion," Rollins lurches into an
introspective and yearning self-examination, with the occasional slap-
on-the-hand bit of common sense of
those who feel hke him: like they're
being sold down the sociological
river in the boat of moral agendas of
Others. Don'tbelieveeverythingyou

of the realm we call popular music.
Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and keyboard player for
Blue Rodeo (yeah, he's the wiggy
guy waving his head around like a
maniac while the rest of them contemplate their navels), this is his
second solo release ihrough WEA
and Lake Michigan Soda has impressed me enough to rank it above
his brilliant In Her Dream LP of
1989.
While In Her Dream consisted of Wiseman's musical interpretations of the poetry of colleague
Wrench Tu ttle, Lake Michigan Soda
showcases the profound power of
his own writing. The politics and
insights of the lyric writing in songs
hke "Diary of a US crop-dusting
pilot spraying the defoliant tebuthi -
the upper huallaga valley (pcru)"
and "Response of a lakota woman to
FBI intimidation circa 1973 pine -.
ridge" cut beneath power struggles
and smokescreens into the nerves
and feelings of the people involved.
On "Into a dinosaur," Bob even
writes from the point of view of an
elephant who's had both of its parents poached for their ivory: "there
was no thank you for your meat / J
there was no thank you for your skin
/your ivory gets us money and cash/
means more than sin." These are not
trendy "issue songs," they are heartfelt attempts to address politics and
grievances that are ignored by mainstream media.
Musically the whole recording w
gallops all over the map, from the
classical "Etude#10opus 666" (featuring Eugene Chadbourne on the
electric rake) to the blazing electric -
guitarsustain of "Diary." Wiseman's
"unique" vocal stylings and maniacal keyboard playing form the com- .^
mon thread lhat binds all these disparate and clashing elements into a
profoundly warped masterpiece.

ITCH
Dyin' To Be Jesus
(Nettwerk/Capitol)
Mark Critchley's Itch have just put
out somepretty heavy duty new stuff.
It makes you laugh, it makes you "**
cry...all right, enough. The album's
called Dyin' To Be Jesus and it's
action packed. The music comes,
initially, as quile a shock in the way
it's presented, but it's a classic situation of "the more I listen to it, the
more I like it." q
The shock comes from the way
the music blasts out at you. At firsl
it seems awkward, as if too many
notes are being crammed into one
space. In reality it's nol a shock, it's
a challenge. The challenge is that the
listener has to keep up with what's
going on. Also, the music doesn't ,rf
seem hke rock, but it is. The riffs are
there but instead of the familiar guitar/bass sound, Mark's piano, and
the way he's recorded the other instruments, come at you in a punching, grinding mass. Sounds like shit,
bul it's tnie. The pounding doesn't really let up until the fifth song "Good
to be Alive," but the heavy duty
build up and climax are still there.
For me, "Photosynthesis" is the big
winner. After those two songs, Itch
start bashing away again without
really letting up.
What I liked about the lyrics
was the sincerity and straightforwardness. It'snice to Usten towords
that mean something and which get
to the point without wasting much
time. It's a blunt honesty that I
haven't seen a lot of. Mark's sense of
humour and, awareness and concern
of the situations around him really
come through in his lyrics.
The band is wicked—Glenn
D'Cruze, Rob Wright and extra bass
players—and Mark Critchley does a
bonus piano piece on the end of the
disc to show where he's coming from.
If you want rock, but something different do the Itch. Yougotta
stop and think aboul it, but it's worth

CURVE
Doppelgdnger
(Anxious/A&M)
A mad rush of sound, squalls of
droning noise, squawks of fuzz and
distortion, insistent dancetrance
rythms, and hemlock-laced honey
How many more paragraphs
hke this are we going to have to read
before the Next Big Thing comes
out of England? Probably not lhat
many. But long after the Brits are
celebrating distorto-techno-foxcore
or whatever the Hell crosses the Atlantic in droves next, I hope Curve
will still be making edgy, uneasy-
listening dance music.
Doppelganger is Uke being
trapped at Luvaffair when you're
on acid, and the drinks are watery,
and your friends have forsaken you
because you're getting too obnoxious, and you've run out of money
but you stick around anyway in the
grim hope that you'UstiU get lucky.
ActuaUy, it's betterthan that.
If they played "Fait AccompU" at
the pissant dance clubs in this city
it might be worth going. Hell, maybe they do, I never go out anymore
because I can Usten to Curve at

what you do: teU your friends you
can't go out, you have to comfort a

on yourheadphones, and slipDop-
pelganger into the Realistic stereo
system your parents gave you for
graduating high school. Leave a
message on your answering machine, "Can't come to the phone,
I'm Ustening to the new Curve and
I'm in another headspace entirely.

THE HARD CORPS
Def Before Dishonour
(East/West Records)
This is about the hardest ofthe new
rap/metal acts, preferring the metal- edged side, other than the style
of groups Uke Urban Dance Squad.
In fact The Hard Corps blow UDS
away, kicking out harder lyrics and
chunkierguitar riffs that draw as much
from MetalUca as il does from Public
Enemy or Boogie Down Productions.
The 13 songs on Def Before Dishonour are going to set a new reference
point for this fledghng style.
Granted, fusion of metal and rap
has been around since "Rock the BeUs"
byLLCoolJandRunDMC'scoverof
"Walk This Way," but Hard Corps u se
a full rock band setup, adding a DJ for
augmentation. This gives more Ufe to
the jam than an army of samplers and
beatboxes ever could. If bozos complain that rap isn't music, throw this in
their face and it'll shut 'em up fast.
However, not aU of the songs
are pleasers. Their cover of AC/DC's
"Back in Black" is kinda lame, and
"Why Can'l We Be Friends", which
borrows from the old War tune, may
be better live. Jam Master Jay shows
that he can produce an album that
reaUy rocks out. Apparently these guys
cooked when they backed up 24/7
Spyz a few months ago, so don't miss
'em when they come by next.

SOCIAL DISTORTION
Somewhere Between Heaven
and Hell
(Epic/Sony)
Famihar with theteim"hippockel band"?
Its definition warrants internment in two
separate camps. One encompasses musicians who have either outgrown or
become bored by the Umitations erected
by a sound that defines them in the minds
of a smaU but devoted audience. Which
eventuaUy aUenates musicians if ihey
even dare to stretch, yawn or breathe
aspiration. Inhabiting the other side are
those musicians who fashion whatever
they like in content and dynamics and
don' t give a flaming expletive what the
world thinks. EventuaUy, the consequence is only a smaU rabid core of
Usteners.
Unninow.Social Distortion epitomized the latter distinction with unforced brazeness. Loud, fast, orthodox
white trash anthems that off-ramp onto
the occasional embrace of country
ringed shufflers. The lyrics are suitably
amplified in keeping with Mike Ness'
favorite songwriting themes of losers
beyond love and redemption, sprinkled with a generous helping of cUches.
Repealing yourself can be forgiveable
in some cases. Ifyou survived years of
punch-ups (some of them with cops),
drunkeness, and heroin use, the very
least you'd want lo do is exploit that
experience.
Somewhere Between Heaven
and Hell is the vehicle of a fairly
simple band doing something aU loo
comphcaled. They purposely sandpaper their inherent strengths into a
finish that sounds better and drives
faster without tinkering away at the
engine. The first two songs, "Cold
Feelings" and "Bad Luck" could be
great singles, if there's such a thing
anymore. The country feel returns in
"99 to Life," a song where Ness
inhabits the world of Kris Kristoffer-
son's "Banks of the Ohio," only to
end up paying for his crime. AU of
Ness' protagonists never emptied a
crumb from the bag, much less sampled "a free lunch."
On the surface, this record won't
indicate any broadening of horizons
from Social Distortion. A single Usien
will provide those answers, but potential is a pretty elusive thing and they're
close to grasping it.
Rob Harrision
KOmwmsOMPtKO'mMONM
Well, folks, I must admit it has been a good month for me. My cup
overfloweth with a swell pile o' vinyl I can pretty much gurantee is tough
to dig up. No theme this month since the foUowing pix are all around the
bend in charmingly unique ways.
First, a tip on buying odd or rare rekkids. Always make sure you
check the album inside before you buy it. Many a time I have picked up
what I thought was an Ed ward Bear picture sleeve 7" of "Last Song" or an
LP of ApoUo 11 space conversations. Drooling uncontrollably, in anticipation of hearing Larry Evoy bark out a tune or Neil Armstrong complain
about lack of toilet paper on the lunar module, I was sooo bumme to pull
out Rick "Let's Freebase in an Airplane" Nelson or The Bob Seger
System. I guess I was so gleeful, I slapped down my $1.25 without
checking. So keep a Ud on your emotions and you'U avoid heartbreak.
But anyway, enough of this tomfoolery, on to this month's Psycho-
sonic Psixpak:
Sonny & Cher - Live
The Tattooed Lady and the future Senator put this one out in 1971. This
was back in the days before record companies realized you should put liner
notes on LPs. No idea where ihis was recorded, but it contains covers of
"What Now My Love" "Danny Boy," and, of course, "The Beat Goes
On."
The tension that was developing in their relationship shows, with
Cher audibly slapping Sonny many times on side two.
CHEEZABILITY RATING: 79
Dr. Who -SoundEffects
This is #19 (!) in a series, put out by B BC Records. Groovy sound effects,
but they are about as cheap as the series looks. Fun to sample these babies
or to put on your answering machine.
CHEEZABILITY RATING: 70
Various Artists - Convoy
This is one of the bummers I mentioned earlier. I got it home and found
a Charley Pride LP in it. Anyway it had fun value, with a string of toy
trucks on the cover and trucker songs Uke "Love Rollercoaster" and "I
Write the Songs." No artist credits, so I assume they got a cheap band
to cover these songs. Oh yeah, it's on Homestead Records, of all
things!! [Home to early Dinosaur Jr.? Wow! Ed.)
CHEEZABILITY RATING: 95 (just "cause it has a CB dictionary on
the back sleeve!)
Betty White - How to Hustle
What more can I say? This does it for me, man. Betts has come out wilh
a training course for the famous "70's dance lhat they taught us in gym
class! This is about the most uncool album I have seen since Redd
Foxx's raw comedy albums. Ifyou find this or any of the other 15 LPs
she put out on things like the Charleston or the Mambo (and it has the
booklet), shde it to me and I'll give you $15. A comedy festival, I
guarantee!
CHEEZABILITY RATING: 100
The Cecil Holmes Soulful Sounds- The Black Motion Picture
Experience
Yow!! Check it out! Cheap instrumental versions of the greatest pimp,
player and hustler flicks of the "60's and "70's! Includes "Theme from
Shaft," "Super Fly" and for some reason, "2001: A Space Odessy."
Worth it just for the cover of "Freddie's Dead" (gives Fishbone a run
for their money). Must have along wilh Icc-T's compilation, Pimps,
Players and Hustlers, which just came out!!
CHEEZABILITY RATING: 110(!)
DISHONOURABLE MENTION	
The Wonder Band - Stairway to Love
Again, I must say YOW!!! Imagine one side of a whole LP consisting
of songs with "Wonder" in the title. PLUS, the incredible "Stairway to
HeavenT'Wholc Lotta Love" MEDLEY!!!!! Disco versions of both
tunes combined, this is the ultimate statement on what pal o' mine BiUy
B. caUs string disco!! I fucking hate Zeppelin and I was offended!!
CHEEZABILITY RATING: 20 (could be one of the worst!!)
Nol being able to follow up that last one, that's about it for now.
Remember the contest I mentioned last month and send me those lyrics!
There's a buncha cool stuff up for grabs!!! And write me care of CITR,
with suggestions of great lost vinyl, ok? Oop, gotta go, Smith <_ Smith
