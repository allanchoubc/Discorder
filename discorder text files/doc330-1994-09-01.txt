As individual artists,
Roger Eno, Kate
St.John (Dream
Academy), Bill
Nelson and Laraaji
have received
enthusiastic praise
and popularity. Now,
united as Channel
Light Vessel, these
performers give
credence to the
adage that the
whole is indeed
greater than the
sum of the parts.

FOR MORE INFO. CONTACT 738-2885/988-8558 Ahhh, autumn. We get our city back
from the tourists, the leaves turn
pretty colours and 1 get to be a lazy
bum/student again. Life is good. I
guess this is as good a chance as
any to finally say hello to all of you
who pick up this dazzling rag every
month. This will be my third issue
as editor and I think I 'm finally getting the hang it - more or less. I've
already passed the Annoy Linda-
the-Station-Manager Test, the Piss
Off a Rock Star and His Record
Company Test and, most importantly, the Live On Nothing But Dr.
Pepper and Grapes For a Week
Test. So far, so good
Like every editor before me I
have ideas about where I would like
to see DiSCORDER go, but I certainly don If consider it to be my
magazine. The success (or failure)
of DiSCORDER depends entirely
upon the contributions of its writers and the people who volunteer
to work on it and I am just one of
those people. The greatest contribution that I can make to the magazine, in my opinion, is to be fair and
honest and to keep an open mind. I
promise never to use such a tired
cliche again, but I really do want
what is best for the magazine and
for the Vancouver scene in general.
In the past DiSCORDER has
been accused of elitism, arrogance
and general head-up-its-own-ass-
edness; I have no intention of denying these accusations or washing
my hands of them on the basis that
I've only been here for a few
months. All I ask is that you keep
an open mind
Well, 'nuffsaid. Hope you like
Dylan Griffith
First things first, Grasshopper! For
now on you will refer to me as Mr.
Vaguely! Second, something I forgot to mention before. Please print
my letter's in full! You did the last
time, but not the first! Hypocrite! I
don't think that you know or realize what you are up against here!
Remember, one day my genius will
surely be compared to that of James
Joyce's or Noam Chomsky's!
As for my "silly tirades", well, I
haven't even awoken the giant!
So, with your kind permission I
would hke the go-ahead for regular
column in your so "humble" yet ego
inflated "rag".
Furthermore, Mr. Colon
Loserest, I think you should have
your own spelling checked, that is
if you are responsible for the ad I
have in question. Check the contests
beside Airhead. A record "pormo".
If you are the one who wrote that!
Shame on you!
So, say yes to the Way and I will
lead you and many others from the
Deathtrap that awaits all of you!
Vic Vaguely
(Death Before Dishonor)
P.S. Thanks for the concern about
my sanity, but it really wasn't nec-
WelL well, well we meet again - in
a manner of speaking. Yes you 're
right, I didn 't print your first letter
in its entirety. I left out the PS.,
which read "And you really graduated. I'm stunned. " Happy now? As
for the record 'pormo,' it's obviously a typo. There's a big difference between incompetence and
stupidity, you know.
I must admit that it has been
amusing, Mr. Vaguely, but I'm
afraid your fifteen minutes are up.
Besides, I'm getting mail from real

Subtext as a chance to rave about
writings that interested me and, with
luck, would appeal to you. During
the course of Subtext the focus
slowly changed from books to comics which are a big passion of mine.
To wind up I thought I'd keep with
tradition and review some comics.
Take care.
^       Paul Auster's Ciry Of Glass
•       Neon yt (Avon, pb $ 14.00)
The most exciting phi
beginning to take hold: Big book
publishers are welcoming comics
with open arms and, most importantly, open budgets. This summer
Avon books presented us with the
first in a new series, Neon Lit: Noir
Illustrated, whose motto is "Where,
in urban shadows, art and literature
meet". The series designer is Art
(Maus) Spiegelman and the editor
is Bob Callahan. Auster's story was
adapted by Paul Karasik and David
Mazzucchelli
who is best
known for his
Rubber Blanket  graphic
sized, up to
•    ie#3).
ending left me slightly baffled perhaps I'll "get it" upon a second reading.
Additional books currently under
way for the Neon Lit series include
Barry Gifford's Petdita Durango, a
sequel to his Wild At Heart, wliich
was made into a film by David
Lynch, and William Lindsay
Gresham's carnival novel Nightmare Alley. Bob Callahan and artist
Scott Gillis are working on Perdita
Durango and novelist Tom
DeHaven (author of tlie incredible
Freaks Amour) and artist Mark
Zingarelli are adapting Nightmare
Alley.
COMIX NEWS
The Complete Concrete (Dark
Horse/Legend) contains the first ten
issues of the Concrete black and
white series wliich introduced tlie
world to Ron Litligow, who had his
brain implanted into a huge rocklike body by aliens (for those not
familiar with Concrete it's not
nearly as
goofy as it
sounds).
Drawn by
author, rather
confusing at times). At last Quinn,
intrigued, says he is Auster. Tlie rest
of the tale sets Quinn on a mission
to seek to find a recently released
mental patient who may wreak terrible revenge. The cartooning is innovative. If Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics was taught as
a course, this book would be prescribed reading.
Although the tale flowed well and
held my interest I will admit that tlie
.ally cru-
fairly standard pri
comix diese days) is
cial, the first issui
thin.... Peter Kuper's Wild Life is i
ally fun. Tlie second issue titled
sexdrugsrockandroll reveals more
of Peter's teenster years in the early
70's, with pot smoking and drug
taking as tlie primary reference.
Peter comes across as a real regular
guy in his comics, not a loudmouth,
or 100% angst ridden but a real true
believable teen....There's an Archie
meets the Punisher comic on the
shelves as I write this. For some a
giggle I say: Next....Did I ever review Dan Savage's Savage Love
comic book? Out on his own Bear
Bones Press, it's a treat. Ellen Tomato Forney, James The Cereal
Killings Sturm and Jay Sin Stephens
are some of the artists who work
with Dan's autobiographical scripts.
Dan and Robert Kirby ai
gay
lales
cartooning....hoo boy, back to Dark
Horse. I picked up White Like She
by Bob Fingerman primarily because Bob had worked on a comic
with Lydia Lunch about a year ago
(The name escapes me, anyhow, it's
about a vampyress). I'm not that
keen on Bob's work, but this rather
intrigued me, from tlie cover of a
woman holding a huge brain on her
back to tlie first few pages which
had a nuclear plant accident and an
instant mutant. Tlie comic turned
out to be a hoot. Very dark humoured and totally
unbelievable... Jlepcats is tlie comic
Martin Wagner produces. Tlie characters have animal faces and regular human bodies. As a result I had
dismissed the comic dunking it was
just anodier "funny animal" book.
— Oh boy was I wrong — someone brought my attention to a recent issue wliich involved cliild rape
and suicide. There were no words
spoken Uiroughout tlie entire issue,
yet die art conveyed a cacophony
of emotion. From there I was
hooked and have been following the
story ever since. Keep an eye out
for die first half of the 18 issue story
entitled Snow-blind, to soon appear
in a collected format....Cryptic
Tymes isn't a comic, but a zine put
out by Alan Wright and his wife
Lisa Lindstrom-Wright. Listeners to
CBC's Nightlines will know this
couple from their 'hours of power'.
They sent Subtext a review copy of
Cryptic Tymes which, sadly at issue
5, is to be the last. Cryptic Times
highlights tlie international garage
scene widi tons of obscure bands
and reviews. Tliis issue includes a
spectacular history of Tlie Wailers.
Send five bucks US to 1011 Boren

Tlie Reading Railroad on Monday
September 19di promises to be a

Kilodney will be reading! Crad, as
you may recall is die fellow who's
written, self published and sold his
books of short stories on die streets
of Toronto since die late 70's. Crad
gave up writing a few years back
yet could still be enticed to visit our
fair city (he'll also read at Denman
Island). Robin Blaser and Jeff
Derksen will also be reading from
dieir latest works.
DRAWN AND QUARTERLY
Drawn and Quarterly is a fantastic name for a comic book publisher:
They indeed produce their comics
four limes a year. The company is
based in Montreal and their comix
are unbelievably good and very
nicely packaged. Titles include
Chester Brown's newest series Underwater, Julie Doucet's Dirty
Plotte, Joe Mart's Peepshow, Dangle by Lloyd Dangle and Palooka-
Ville by Seth. The newest addition
to the D & Q "stable" of artists is to
be Adrian Tontine whose self-published Optic Nerve (up to issue #7)
will debut next Spring. Drawn and
Quarterly also has a self-titled publication profiling various artists.
This Drawn and Quarterly focus
looks at the trio of pals who often
appear in each other's comix: Chester, Joe and Seth.
Chester Brown creates highly
original, touching comics which
have been released around the
world. His first few issues of Yummy
Fur were reprints of his mini-comics. The next 18 issues consisted of
the "Ed The Happy Clown"
storyline, a tale which involves
vampyres, missing persons, security
types and oh yes, the head of
Ronald Reagan attached to a penis. The Ed saga is available in
a collected book and the film
version (complete with computer graphics for the penis shots)
is being directed by Bruce
McDonald (do yourself a
favour and run to your
video store and rent his
films Roadkill and
Highway 61).
After the Ed story
Chester moved to
autobio     material
which included detailing his teenage
experiences   with
pornography in The Playboy using
his own image as an elfish winged
observer watching his teenage-self
diroughout the
comic. The angst filled Fuck
storyline ran for the last six issues
of Yummy Fur. In Fuck, Chester's
experiences widi girls and his family are viewed. A savvy marketing
move has the title softened to /
Never Liked You for the collected
Chester stopped Yummy Fur this
year at issue 31 (it had been published quarterly since December
86). After a six month absence
Chester's fans could check out his
newest work, Underwater which
debuted last month. (At press time
I hadn't picked up a copy yet.) Underwater is a work of fiction detailing several weeks in the life of a
woman. The storyline is set to span
at least 20 issues.
Seth has longed at times for the days
of the 20's and 30's when things
were seemingly more simple and
honest. His drawings are reminiscent of diis era, the light airy style
reminds one of cartoons from say,
New Yorker magazine. In fact, at the
moment Seth is halfway through die
storyline of how he began collecting the cartoon work of artists found
in old New Yorker's from the 40's
and 50's, especially diose of "Kalo"
who turned out to be a Canadian
named Jack
comic Palooka-Ville is up to it's
sixth issue: Tlie first introduces us
to Seth as he appeared in the mid
80's, a white haired dandy — die
bleach-job in constant need of
retouching by his very patient girlfriend. The text details how Seth
was beaten up for appearing to
"faggy" for some hoodlums. Tlie
second and third issues took us back
to Seth's teen years where he
worked a summer job at a resort, in
this story Seth (or his character)
loses his virginity to his bosses unhappily married wife. The current
New Yorker storyline will wrap up
after six issues.
The next Palooka-Ville storyline
will be a serious look at the true
story of Steven Truscott, who in the
60's was accused of raping and
murdering a little girl in his town
of Clinton, Ontario (Seth's hometown: his older siblings went to
school with Steven). Truscott, then
14, was jailed upon very litde evidence under shaky circumstances to
say the least (supposedly he had
been the last person to see the girl).
At age 30 Truscott was released
from prison, primarily due to a re-
emergence of public outcry over the
case. Seth plans this storyline to last
For the first 6 issues of Peepshow
(#7 out by the time you read this)
Joe Matt portrayed himself as a
cheapskate, petulant, mean-to-his-
girlfriend, porno-video-playin',
lazy and oh so misunderstood artiste. Joe was in town visiting
Chester and they came over for
: coffee, he and I made plans to
,' shoot a game of snooker later
that week and...he bailed on me!
Stood up by Joe Matt. Good grief.
What makes Peepshow so fascinating is that Matt goes on and on
about things which actually happen
that anyone with half a brain
would NOT shout to the world
ah, no offence, Joe). His first
:ew issues actually made his
girlfriend, Trish, break up with
him — he had been obsessively lusting after a workmate of hers. Joe portrays
hi n lself as such a sadsack that
you're tempted to both smack him
and buy him a good meal.
There's a collected book also called
Peepshow (Kitchen Sink) which
shows the work Joe did in 1987 before his comic debuted. I hke these
single panel pages best. Each large
page has dozens of tiny cartoon
boxes in which Joe details his life
and times. Very funny material
about religion, school, girl trouble
and how to save money.

other women, I would want to be
gay. Before I lose whatever homosexual audience I may be so lucky
to posess, let me explain. Like most
of thehetro male population, I think
the act of love between two women
is very sexy. Two men, too, for that
matter. Though I think the fact that
gay people have had to face oppression of every kind is heinous, I
dig the resulting iron-clad sense of
community that has developed
amongst those who are out. And I
am thrilled by the community itself, exceedingly vibrant and, for
the most part, beautifully open.
These may all be just surface impressions of a lifestyle that
I could never possibly understand,
given my lack of real desire for my
own gender. They could also indicate a sub-consiously twisted, voyeuristic attraction to a group that
is excitingly "different" from myself. With only Psych 101 under
my scholastic belt, I am inclined to
forgo the intense analysis of my
motivations and just accept the fact
that I find the whole tiling fascinating.
I am mesmerized by the
transformation of man to woman
and vice versa. I am astounded by
the accounts of queer life before
there was a movement or support
or even the slightest bit of knowledge about the condition. I am awed
by the stories, funny and frightening, of life in the gay bars before
the Stonewall riots of 1969. Mostly,
my sense of humanity is affirmed
by the personal testimonials of beings who have addressed what odi-
ers would often term as dieir "problem" and have become stonger for
their having to "decide" to be diem-
Before I melt into a puddle of my own sticky sentiment, de-
evolve into Freudian analysis, or
forever label myself a fag hag, I will
come to the subject of tliis mondi's
column; Queer Film.
The subject, and genre,
are hotter than this summer's
weather. Gay filmmakers are Tlie
Next Thing on the agenda of film
liistory in North America, much like
young black filmmakers were Tlie
Thing a few years ago. In die last
two years, Gregg Araki's The Living End, David Ansen's Poison, and
the late Derek Jarmin's Edward II
all received press unprecidented in
the realm of gay cinema.
This summer, from July 19th
to 24th, Vancouver hosted its sixdi
Gay film festival, Out on Screen.
The event screened over 100 films
and videos by and about lesbians,
gay men, and bisexuals. Committed to providing a forum for previously unheard voices and to showing the diversity of experience
within the queer community, this
year's festival emphasized shorter
works, particularly diose produced
on video. Happy attendee Les
Vegas cited his personal highlights
as: The Straight Agenda, an hilarious parody of a right wing, fundamentalist Christian, propaganda/
hate film called The Homosexual
Agenda; Kisses on a Train, a beautifully simple film about die friendship of two young girls in India;
and It's a Family Affair, an inspiring program of shorts that challenged die traditional definition of
My own little odyssey
into the queer screen scene began,
as do all my DISCORDER film
journeys, at Videomatica on Fourth
Avenue where, in that modest looking retail space, they house one die
this city's larger collections of gay
and lesbian diemed flicks. (Butt
Boys from Outer Space is not in
dieir library)
Choosing films in die
time-honoured by-the-blurb
mediod, in five minutes I amassed
a large list of features diat I had to
see. Luckily for my poor, withered
eyes, I quickly discerned diat there
are almost no gay/lesbian diemed
movies diat last more dian 90 minutes. As an ignorant (and heterosexual) film critic, I refuse to contemplate why diis is.
I tried to choose a 50-
50 documentary/drama split but I
found die former so interesting dial
I didn't have time in die end to gel
my quota of the latter up to par.
The shelves themselves were
stocked about 60-40 favouring dramas, a somewhat unusual ratio
considering that the "straight"
documentary section comprises
about 5%, or less, of any video
store's stock. Tlie community's
emergence from shadow in the past
25 years has obviously inspired
many gay filmmakers to explore
and record the roots of their kind
and their experiences within a hostile North American society.
I am pretty sure I know what inspired the first "documentary" I
slid silkily into the VCR and it was
not the desire to tell a tale of oppression or strength through community. Movie Buff (which was
sequelled by Movie Buff II, III, and
IV) is comprised entirely of scenes
from mainstream movies that feature male nudity, preferably of the
famous kind. Hosted by some
porn/B-movie schmuck named
Steve Malis (who
would need lessons in
acting to play himself, or to play with
himself, naturally),
most of these "sexy"
scenes are just hazy
butt shots from early
in the careers of such
studs as Richard
Gere, Don Johnson,
and Johnny Depp. I
would describe it as
the least titillating
week, but I

Age" of lesbian fiction in the 1950's
and '60's, a small dramatic piece
unfolds in chapters as small-town
"Laura" is rejected by her girlhood
lover and ventures off to the big city
to find herself. Between instalments, women from Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal discuss the phenomenon of lesbian literature, gender role-playing within female couples, police and public harassment,
the bar scenes, and a host of other
savoury tidbits that Canadians, for
the most part, would never even
guess were a part of the social his-
rons of Maude's I paddled to the
boys only wild west of my first dramatic selection, Song of the Loon.
Set in the late 19th century Pacific
Northwest, Song of the Loon traces
the tender journey of a frontier boy
who wants to come to grips bodi
with his sexuality and with a sturdy
mountain man. Inhibiting him are
preconceived perceptions of sexual
preference and a evil, repressed ex-
lover who is stalking him. I learned
from Song of the Loon that:
l.The Old West was inhabited entirely by men, all of whom were
speak of, there are an overabundance of glorious back-lit shots of
trees, rivers and mountains. As a
ninety minute travel commercial
for rustic-minded gays, Song of the
Loon is splendid, though a bit long.
As a feature movie extolling the
virtues of the satisfied homosexual
life, it's a little transparent and still
too long.
Made for British TV
and starring John Hurt, The Naked
Civil Servant is a very good argument for the position that the English are infinitely more civilized
than we, their North American
counterparts. Try to imagine an
NBC-commissioned TV biography of [fill in American gay icon
here] that starred Charlie Sheen as
a husiling, then aging, then defiant queer, which would be broad-
0 million American homes on a Sunday evening
and you'll have an inkling of my
comparison. Thank god the repressive entities dial control television in die US haven't yet gotten
clutches on the
Canadian video market and I was
able to spend 80 minutes widi die
ever-charming Crisp/Hurt and his
exquisitely pithy rules for life:

erotica and so I will
leave off judgement
in that a
glad that I have si
Movie Buff been
have managed to satisfy the perverse curiosity that c
over me whenever I saw the box
in the store. I am equally glad that
I didn't actually pay to rent it and
had die excuse of research to fall
back on when succumbing to its
guilty, not-so thrilling pie;
More in line with die
standard in queer documentaries
was Before Stonewall, an impressive attempt to provide a living
archive of gay and lesbian social
history in the US. Beginning in the
1920's and arranged into chapters
by decade (ending with the 60's
and die 1969 Stonewall riots), Before Stonewall focuses on life in
die only two places in the "land of
die free" where there was any semblance of a homosexual t
nity: New York and San Francisco.
Done in my favourite style - Talking Heads - interviewees r
ber aspects of their lives as members of an outcast group: the harassment, the fear, and the secrecy.
Also included, however, are more
cheering memories of fun, revelry
and close companionship. Created
by Greta Schihler, Before Stonewall succeeds in providing a celluloid path from the first fledgling
groups of big-city homosexuals to
die 1969 outburst of rage against
repression and oppression known
as Stonewall.
My next nonfiction
choice, Forbidden Love has many
of die elements of Before Stonewall. It, too, features a handful of
interviewees talking about their experiences in the scene before the
"scene" was publicly tolerated.
Tliis feature, however, focuses on
Canadian lesbians and uses a
unique "tableau" framework to
separate the different interview
segments. Imitating, and/or parodying, storylines from die "Golden
tory of our country.
Made by Aerlyn
Weissman and Lynne

from the National
Film Board, Forbidden Love stood apart
from the other documentaries for its sheer

films I watched
interesting; Forbidden Love was scintil-
rowly centred than
Forbidden Love, and,
to my judgment, less
appealing for it, was
Last Call at Maude's.
Recounting the history of a famous lesbian bar in San Francisco which closed down a
few years ago, Last Call uses the
owner, staff and past patrons of the
bar to remember on film what
Maude's meant to the scene and to
the individuals that scene was made
up of. The film does have interesting things to say about the way the
lesbian community has changed (no
one drinks any more) or hasn't
changed (the easiest way to find the
lesbians in any town is to head over
to the local Softball diamond) but
too much time is taken up, especially at the end, commemorating
the bar's closure. If I had been a
regular at Maude's, I'm sure I
would have appreciated the goodbye awards ceremony and the detailed descriptions of former employees but as this was my introduction to the club, those bits
dragged.

Tlie most unfortunate thing about
Song of the Loon is diat despite director Andrew Herbert's ambitions
to tell a beauteous gay fable, he's
somewhat lacking in actual plot
content.   Lacking a conflict to

You may not get out of die store
again without a selection from its I see from the calendar that September is upon us again, bringing rain,
the official start of Fall, crowded
morning bus rides to campus, and of
course, tuition payments. But wait,
it's not all bad! September is also the
beginning of another season for most
of the local classical music societies,
and if by some chance you have anything left in the bank after making
the annual trek to Brock Hall and the
tuition desk you might want to set it
aside to attend one of the many great
concerts coming up.
But first, an explanation. Some of
you may have noticed the lack of this
fine column from last month's issue.
This was not (as rumor had it) because I saw Elvis in one of my petri
dishes and spent the month talking
to him and transcribing his favorite
recipes to soon be released as a book
and later as motion picture. The simple fact is that there really wasn't
much going on in terms of local classical music; the weather was much
too nice to be sitting in a laminar flow
hood, and the fishing was good. In
short, you didn't miss anything.
The classical scene has been a
much busier one of late, though.
Early Music Vancouver, with the assistance of UBC's School of Music
and The Canada Council Touring
Office, put on the Vancouver Early
Music Festival. This was a series of
four workshops (for the musicians)
and eight concerts (for those of us
who find it too artistically challenging to play anything other than the
CD machine). The program for the
festival included many names familiar to local early music aficionados,
including the groups Sequentia and
The King's Noyse. A group I was
not familiar with was Musick Fyne,
hailing from Toronto and consisting
of Mary Enid Haines (soprano),
Terry McKenna (lute, mandolin, and
guitar), Allison Melville (flute and
recorder), Colin Savage (clarinet and
recorder), and Valerie Weeks (harpsichord). Having previously heard
all of these people in recordings only,
I thought it would be interesting to
hear them in person, so I went to then-
August 7th concert, entitled "From
the Old World to the New."
Like the other concerts of the series it was held at the UBC Recital
Hall, an excellent choice of venue
for works of this nature due to its excellent acoustics and small size,
which gives the performance a re-
ioE£^c£jriIrj_a
laxed feel and (importantly for much
early music) allows all of the audience to hear softer instruments hke
the medieval flute which featured
prominently in many of the works
performed for this conceit.
A pre-concert introduction was
given by Allison Melville, who proceeded to explain the meaning behind the title of the concert. When
most of us think of 'early music', we
generally immediately think of the
composers and venues of Western
Europe which make up the majority
of western music from the 17th and
18th centuries. Musick Fyne chose
instead in this concert to focus on
works as performed by the settlers
of North America dating to this era.
It was an interesting idea, and one
which they did a successful job of
bringing to life through a lot of background research and a li vely presen-
The program was divided into
five sections, with each one dealing
with works of a common nature. The
opening section was entitled Mrs.
Sutherland's Coffee House - Halifax,
1790 and was patterned after records
of a concert hosted by a Mrs.
MechfJer on the 20th of September
of that year. Among the more staid
works on the program (works by
Bach and Dibdin) was a set of excerpts from the ballad opera Hasina.
It was this set of excerpts which
Musick Fyne fittingly chose for their
opening.
The ballad opera was a particularly North American musical form
originating in a culture where musical talent was much more common
than was a classical education. Very
few people really wanted to go to a
musical presentation such as the
European incarnation of the opera -
which would most likely be sung in
a language they didn't understand
(often Italian) and deal with situations they didn't identify with. Someone had the bright idea of targeting
this large, untapped audience with
something they would really enjoy
(and spend money on) - a 'Beggar's
Opera,' based on simple story lines
and accompanied by music in which
the audience could recognize simple
themes based on their own folk
songs. The form gained rapid popularity in North America and attracted
the attention of English composer
William Shield, who wrote Rosina
to fit the bill. It was a success in
North America, as demonstrated by
the Halifax concert where Mrs.
Mechder herself took the main sing-
ing parts.
The excerpts performed by
Musick Fyne were the instrumental
overture (based on a harpsichord lesson) and four vocal works (one of
which was to music by Pleyl, and
another to music by Sacchini). While
the passage of time has obscured
what were at the time common melodies, the music still has the power to
enchant and Mrs. Haines' lovely
voice and endearing stage manner
were solidly rounded out by the engaging performances by the instrumentalists. I did find, however, that
I really didn't gain much by the singing being in English; I still had a very
hard time understanding much of it
due to the speed and wide tonal range
employed.
The second selection A Choice
Medley for the Ball was even more
delightful, focusing on the purely instrumental dance music from the late
1700's. Starting with a quadrille, this
set continued with "The Constellation" (a bright work marred somewhat by the faintness of the medieval transverse flute; it would be hard
to imagine the dancers at any ball
actually being able to hear it), "New
Contredance" (by Henri Capron),
and ending with then aditional works
"Drunken Sailor" and "Spirit of New
Orleans." Terry McKenna's playing
on strings was particularly good, and
most of the audience were tapping
their feet to the music by the end of
the first work.
The third section requires some
explanation. Four years ago the
members of Musick Fyne commissioned Canadian composer John
Beck with to write a work in the form
of a documentary cantata to portray
the 1773 voyage of the Hector, a ship
bringing mostly poor, Gaelic-speaking Scottish fanning families to a
new life in Pictou, Nova Scotia The
hardships these people were to face
in the new world were foreshadowed
by the harsh voyage they met with;
smallpox broke out on board killing
many children, and a hurricane drove
the ship so far off course that food
and water had to be stringently rationed to last more than twice as long
as originally planned. In spite of this
the settlers did not give up hope; they
persevered and went on to make lives
for themselves in the fine new world
they found waiting. The resulting
work, entitled "The Hector," was
premiered by Musick Fyne in 1990
during a tour which included the village of Pictou.
In many ways I found myself
feeling a certain kinship with the oppressed settlers as I listened to this
work. The composer chose to employ instruments in two different
tunings for some sections of the work
in order to portray the stormy conditions of the voyage. Interspersed with
these mildly discordant passages,
Ms. Haines alternately recited a commentary and sang songs in Gaelic.
Thus, overall, the work is totally
modem in character and suffers from
the common faults (and, I presume,
the strengths?) of its contemporaries: a lack of continuity and, as a consequence, a lack of approachability
for the average listener. While I must
admit to being impressed by the
Gaelic song sections, I found the
work as a whole to be markedly out
of place both for this ensemble and
for the concert. I do not doubt that
the members of Musick Fyne may
have enjoyed performing the work,
but their audience was there to hear
baroque music; if they wanted to
hear modern music they would have
gone to a recital hosted by Early
Music Vancouver or something similar. An interesting idea and an 'A' for
effort, but not the proper venue for
this particular work.
After the intermission the conceit
continued in a more fitting note with
Musique de la nouvelle France, featuring works of a traditional folk nature from Quebec and Acadia including "Mon Pere n' avait fille que moi,"
"Le Sergent," three versions of "A
la claire fontaine, la court paille," and
"Via l'bon vent." These lively
pieces (particularly the last) were delightfully done.
The final set, The Urania Academy, was named for a popular musical venue of early 18th century Philadelphia and consisted of two sections; an instrumental group with the
Scottish composer James Oswald's
"The Marvel of Peru" (a short and
musically ornate work in three
movements), J.C Bach's "Sonata in
D", and local Philadelphian
Benjamin Carr's "Rondo," followed
by a choral group with "Bonny
Charley" (published by John Young),
Storace's "Lullaby" from his opera
The Pirates, the traditional
"Lochaber," as arranged by J.C.
Bach, and, finally, "Ariel's Song"
from The Tempest by Thomas Arne.
These final works did an especially
good job of showcasing the talent
comprising Musick Fyne and
brought the musicians the rousing
applause they deserved. In return,
they performed the traditional Scottish song "The Bonny Broom" as an
encore to bring to a close a very entertaining and enjoyable concert.
Part of what made the concert so
enjoyable was Musick Fyne's relaxed stage presence. They performed as though in front of a small
group of friends, much in the manner the early North American performers they were attempting to echo
must have. A performance in which
the musicians take the time to actually look at the audience and introduce the works always feel much
more 'live' than one presented in a
cold and formal manner and, with the
exception of one work ("The Hector"), I found this presentation to be
very successful at evoking the image of the settler's concert.
Time to take a look at what's on
the musical agenda for September.
The VSO officially opens their 75th
season with a concert in their
Masterworks series, presenting
Sergiu Comissiona conducting
Mahler's Second Symphony (otherwise known as the Resurrection
Symphony) with the Vancouver Bach
Choir and guest soloists Louise
Russel (soprano) and Corina Circa
(mezzo-soprano). Also on the program is Applebaum's A Place Setting. Performances will be on September 24lh and 26th, 8:00 PM at
theOrpheum.
The Vancouver Recital Society is
having their season opener at the
Vancouver Playhouse, 8:00 PM on
September 18th, hosting baritone
Christopher Nomura
Early Music Vancouver is presenting two concerts; the first is
Marty Feldman's Patterns in a Chromatic Field (a full-evening work) on
the 17th, and the second (to be held
on the 18th) is a collection of shorter
works including One13 by John
Cage, C-A-G-E by Michael
Bachtischa, Intercomunicazione by
Bernd Zimmermann, and De
Pmfundis by Frederic ], an especially
interesting work (composed around
the writings done by Oscar Wilde
while in prison) which has been receiving very favorable acclaim. Both
performances are at 8:00 PM at the
Vancouver East Cultural Center.
Most of the other local music societies seem to be waiting for October to begin their seasons, so that's
it until next month. Good listening
until then!

Velocity Girl seems to be one of
those cutesy college rock quirks
gone right. Ever since their catchy
single "My Forgotten Favorite"
made it big on the college radio
scene in 1992 and the 'college-
geek shoegazers' tag was
enthusiastically slapped onto their
freshly scrubbed foreheads,
Velocity Girl have been on a
quick and pretty much
unencumbered path to success.
Now, in July of 1994, after a
string of singles and compilation
contributions for such stellar indie
labels as Simple Machines and
Slumberland, as well as a much
lauded debut album (.Copacetic),
Velocity Girl have emerged with
their untarnished, lovable image
intact and are continuing their
winning streak. It seems that these
kids just can't to lose: they've
recently settled into a cozy five
album deal with Sub Pop and have
just released their second full-
length effort, entitled Simpatico. I
caught up with the clean-cut crew
at the Town Pump recently, where
drummer Jim Spellman and
guitarist Brian Nelson were
mumbling their way through
dinner before their show.
Apparently the speedy Velocity
Girl herself, Sarah Shannon, can't
sit still long enough to endure an
interview for she took off
immediately after sound check for
her customary pre-performance
jog and I was left to mull over the
band's spotless success with Jim
and Brian. My trusty friend Julie,
who had agreed to come along
and act as photojournalist on the
condition she wouldn't remember
anything about the encounter by
morning (a condition, by the way,
which she took for all it was
worth - AND MORE!), managed
to snap a few winning smiles from
the kids in between her drunkenly
enthusiastic exchanges with
soundman and bass guitarist Kelly
Riles. Here's what went down:
Discorder: O.K. Can you
introduce yourselves?
Jim: I'm Jim from Velocity Girl.
Brian Nelson: I'm Brian from
Velocity Girl.
Kelly Riles: I'm just assisting in
So where did you guys just
come from? Are you far into
your tour?
Jim: Half-way across country,
and up one country. We're lialf-
way done, we started in
Philadelphia , went to Boston and
then across the top of the country.
Did you guys play Seattle yet?
Jim: Tomorrow. Aud (lie next
Brian: We just spent ihe last two
days driving, so {it's} kind of nice
to have something to do now.
You guys toured a lot for
Copacetic too right?
Brian: Yeah, well, we did two
montlis, I guess two separate
tours: one opening for Belly and
another one on our own. and Uieu
we'd gone to Europe for a couple
of weeks so it was just kind
of...Oh I have to order my
food...and I'd like you to know
that I'm going to get. (to
waitress) Do you have a tossed
salad of some sort?
Waitress: We have a Caesar
salad.
Brian: O.K. could I get a Caesar
salad and an order of frendi fries.
Waitress: You sure can.
Brian: Thank you.
Jim: Once the microphone's off
it'll be make that a double
cheeseburger.
So, have you been on the road
then for most of the past year
Brian: I wouldn't say most of the
year, but a good portion of it. We
did a couple weeks in England
and that amounted to hke about
almost a month, and then we did
these two other month long - or
hke five week long - tours. So we
were out for like three and a half
montlis or something hke that,
wliich is not a lot for some bands
but a lot for us.
Everyone always writes what
ardent anglophiles you are -
what was England like?
Brian: I don't know if that is
strictly true, although we do hke
a lot of English bands. But we
did alright in England. It's just
THE PITPUB * INTHE BASEMENTOFTHESIWENTUNION MAIDING, 6138 SUB BLVD. * 604-822-6511
By Kazi Stastna
kind
of weirdii think the
press over there is completely -
they make it up as ihey go along. I
mean, >ou're a hero one week and
>:   a sell mo die next. So there's no
way to really evaluate how well
you do iu England except the-
audiences, and in I-ondou we've
always done really well.
So was that the first time you
Brian; Yeah. Well, it was two
separate trips of like a week and a
half each.
Did you have any memorable
tour moments or anything?
Brian: I don't know, I C3n't
renumber any of it; I was tcx>
drunk. I got liil by a car in New
York - that was pretty memorable.
Tlie second night ,1 guess, we were
wilh Belly; we were doing two      :.
shows for two nights - two shows
each night - and tlie second show
in between I'd yone over to
CBGB's with Jim and anodier guy
from Sub Pop am) we were
walking back to lite show across
die street, you know, like 15
minutes before we're supposed to
be on, Jamil a «ir turned the
: corner, ran Die light and smacked
ine up on tlie side. 1 sort of saw it
chilling, bul f didn't really get hurt
or anything. But the driver.kind
of...they were yelling at the driver
and sort of a little bit of a fight
ensued, t think tlie driver look (lie.
worst of il between Jim and our
friend Dave from Sub Pop.
Did you go on (hat night?
Brian: Oh yeah ! Five minutes
after I picked my sorry ass up off
the New York pavement.
Wow. I think ihe last time you
guys were here you toured with
Belly right?
Brian: Last time we were here at
the Town Pump I think it was just
Jim: We played at Graceland with
Belly. We played here with cub
and somebody else.
Do you think that there is a big
difference between being an
opening band or headlining or is
it kind of just whoever is on the
bill?
Brian: Oh I think that there is a big
difference. I mean it sort of
depends on who you're touring
with.
Jim: There's a lot less people
when we're headlining.
Brian: Yeah, a lot less people
A2U8^°ms&£ there a point, you think, when
make a conscious transition
being an opening band to
show?
Well I think it just sort of
on, you know, arcurn-
Ve were dunking about
this lour as an opening act
lere weren't really any
I we wanted to go out
's just kind of weird. I
figured we could do
alright on our own and we needed
_       a tour now, soon after the record
™      came out, so it was just kind of...
What about Sunny Day Real
Estate, did you guys choose
them?
Brian: I think it was sort of set up
i with Sub Pop. Sub Pop suggested
f**|       it and they wanted to do it.
Do you know much about them?
Brian; Well we've learned a lot
about them playing with lliem
every night for the past two weeks
or whatever. They're great. We
had seen them a couple times
©      before and had met them son of in
: Seattle briefly, but uh...yeali,
: they're greal, they're awesome.
Kelly: Cm 1 gel a shot of
Jagermeistet? fon Julie's
recorrunendation no doubt]
t's illegal in B.C„:Sj#
'Julie: (in loud whiny drunken
tone) My father drinks
Jagermeister continuously!
Right Well, when I was reading
stuff about you guys it seemed
like you gained a fair bit of
notoriety and success fairly
quickly. Do you think it kind of
came easily to you or did you
have to struggle?
Brian: I think it sort of came
unexpectedly. I mean, we put out
the"Forgotten Favorite" 7 inch
and after that sort of a I >t i f
people started writing about us
and we played a few shows on (lie
east coast and it just kind of
happened all of a sudden. Since
then it has sort of built up a hale
bit [but] we were just sort of
another buzz-band, I think, for a
while, which is kind of a burden.
With "Forgotten Favorite," it
seems like you read about it and
people call it the perfect pop
song. When you were writing it
did you anticipate that kind of
reaction or was it just another
Jim: Well, we were
exctled. 1 think we sort
of knew that it was
good, but no'..J've read
so much BS aboul il " '.
like 'it crystallized the: :
movement into a force*
- like litis complete
dross, you know. I'm
glad people hke it
duaigh.
Yeah, well, people
have dubbed it as
being very 'hit-ish', a
kind of Hit of the
Week type thing,
Brian: I think we all
just though! it was die best song
we had .so we just put our foot out.
It didn't seem like that special of a
Do you think that "Sorry
-Again" off the new album has
that same hit-ish feel?
Brian: I don't know, dial's just :
sort of the song that we all agreed
would be the best first single. We
don't really know, we sort of
debated about it a lot. I mean, we
tried to write as many hits as we
could, [but] ifs lord to decide.
Do all of you guys write in the
bund? Does everybody Wind of
contribute?
Brian: We all write novels.
Jim: Everybody writes.
■   :>::        '
So there's no clearly defined
roles or anything?
Jim: It varies a lot from song tc
Kelly: Person... .
Brian: ...to person.
Jim: From hit to hit, everybody
Kelly: Except I write 92 percent
of die songs.
Jim: (lo the lune of R.E.M.'s
"Everybody Hurts") Everybody
writes, sometime.
So when you collect stuff for an
album is it just stufT that has
emerged over a longer period::::
or do you record in shorter
chunks?
Jim: Well, it's sort of like
[we] have a certain amount
of songs that [we] write
and some parts that
[aren't] fully flushed out
and then we sit down and, you
know, starting with that and then
adding all this other stuff build the
album from diere; So it sort of
goes bodi ways. And here's Dan
from Sunny Day Real Estate...
(Enter Dan. stage left)
Brian: Dan, by die way, Is an
excellent player of the game
Kancky.
Jim: KARICKY!!! K-A-R-0-A-K-
E. It's Karoake. (looking down at
my notes) You got a lol of
questions there. Are all those
questions? Let's pull a few out.
Kelly: We're asking tlie questions
Jim: We're asking die questions
N00000!!!!!
Jim (reading direcdy from my
question sheet yet somehow
managing to make it sound a
trillion times more pointless and
blast* than w
Now, just as
media and stuff—often when Ihe
locale of Washington D.C. is
mentioned in tlie music press,
the word hardcore is not too far
behind- where do you think we
Jit into tliis?
Where do I think you fit in? I
don't think you fit in.
After a brief interlude during
which Kelly tried to convince
Jitu tliat they should go to
Windsor, Ontario, I managed to
rescue my questions <vxd carry
on with the interview.
Well, you know how you were
saying earlier that you became
a buzz band? Well there seems
to be a whole slew of buzz
words thai keep cropping up,
like anglophile, shoega/Jng,
My Bloody Valentine, college
geeks...Are you happy with
that kind of image being
associated wilh yourselves?
Brian: I don't mind die college
geek tiling.
But was that all a media
creation or did you perpetuate
that?
Jim: Well die thing is, somebody
writes it al one (joint, like when
you're first starting out, and then
you decide alone point, 'well,
we should have a press kit'; so
then you give:* press kit, but
dien when: i writer
wants to do
you they
ask to
of image of yourselves?
Maybe vaguely, a little bit.
Brian: We never really thought
dial we were in the public eye or
anything. I think if anything now
I wish people would shut up
about My Bloody Valentine.
Thai's last year's record.
If you hud your choice of buzz
words would there be any?
Brian; Velocity Girl,
Jim; One tiling though, almost
every good baud, especially in die
last len years, get- completely
compared to somebody else. I
really can't tliaok of very many
bands dial don't get compared to
somebody else. So at least it's
O.K. to think about that. 1 meau,
Pavement are a greal band but
people always write about who
diey sound like, [and] il doesn't
really matter. WheUier it's true or
not they're still a good band. If
diey sound like tlie Fall or
something it still sounds great,
you know. So many people write
like rock journalists [and] txit too
much emphasis on journalism,
like getting fothe bottom of tlie
story. Wliich is gixxl* but I would
like to see al tins point 'I hke
-this.' You never see a journalist
say 'Ild^uiisbaiicla1---'
band makes me feel a
way.' It's always like I'll
down and analyze all the f
and pertinent issues and then
come up with a conclusion based
on these facts.
Brian: It's always iu the search
for an angle, you always >
think there's a scene going
bands - hke the non-hardcore D.C.
bands hke us and Tsunami and
Unrest and I don't know, whoever
else, The Eggs or something - as
hke this scene or something, and
none of those four bands sound
even remotely alike, not even
vaguely. But it's sort of hke it links
things easily in a time and place
and you can make nifty httle flow
charts about the bands and who
dated who in the bands and which
labels the bands are on or
something. It's kind of silly, but if I
was a writer and was making my
money doing it I'm sure that's what
I would end up doing too because,
you know, it's a familiar lexicon.
You guys recently signed a five
album deal with Sub Pop: Does
that put any kind of new
pressure on you at all?
|  Jim: Well, if you don't want to
j make a record they can't really
make you make a record.
• Brian: Yeah, there's not hke a
tiling...I mean, if we broke up
tomorrow it wouldn't matter.
Did you do it more for the
security?
Brian; Well, I llunk that diey
offered tlie best...
Jim: Hide's no security, ihey can
drop you any lime.
Brian: Yeah, the deal is thai after
any record that they're not happy
::   with for whatever reason, you can
be dropped from lite label. I mean
we just did it because they were die
best label or whalever...lhey made
the best offer. And it's sort of kind
of a tlung where you have to reach
of a balance between
what a band wanLs and whatdie
label wants. I mean, initially we
wanted to sign to Sub Pop for as
little records as possible because
diought 'well, we'll put
out a record on Sub
Pop and if il
does
ind]read
what die first
person wrote and then
maybe they listen to your
villi that in mind and then
diey say 'Oh yeah,' and then.
diey say 'I think that guy's right'
and then they ask the same
question. I have proof that thai
happens because we did an
interview (ot Alternative Press
like two years ago, and diey
i* asked us these kind of weird
questions like what our day jobs
were and we had really boring
day jobs, hke nothing exciting at
all - you know, record store,
Sears, whatever - but then
everybody asked that!
So you didn't start out trying
to consciously project some
Uling
unifying
happening, like
another hippie culture,
another punk rock culture,
another whatever. I think it's
narrow - people want to be in
bands, they want to make music,
they don't really affiliate
themselves as strongly with those
kinds of scenes.
Jim: I think usually when writers
say a scene it doesn't really have
much to do with music but almost
always has to do with, hke, time
and place more than a sound.
Like people write about the D.C.
sign us
we might get
a better offer
from a bigger
label.' So now,
after the first
record did so well,
ihey made a lot of
promises to us in terms
of being able to help us
/       better distribute our
records than they have
been able to in die past. It
just seemed like die logical
thing to do: sign for more
records wilh them.
It seems like you've done a lot of
7 inches and compilations in tlie
past, but now that you've done
two full-length albums are you
still going to continue doing 7
inches?
Brian: As long as the 7 inch lives
we will put diem out!!! [lauglis]
Jim: Unfortunately it's sort of a
matter of time. We don't have as
much time to do one-off things
because it's like, you know, put
out a record, tour for a month,
have two weeks off, tour for a
month, two weeks off, tour for a
month...and then hunker down
and write some songs, but by
then you don't really have that
much left.
So has this totally ci
your life now or do you have
time to do non-music things?
Jim: It's sporadic. It's like this
month we're doing nothing else,
then we're home for like two
and a half weeks. There's
sometimes when it does take up
everything but then there's a lot
of times when you can just, you
know, sleep in [and] watch a lot
oft.v.
Lastly, I wanted to ask you
about this side project of
yours, Piper Club. What's
going on with that?
Jim: Actually, it's c-u-b- Piper
Cub - it was a misprint. Our
first national press coverage and
they misspelled our name, and
now everybody read the press
kit and misprinted it so we
might as well just change our
name. It's me and my next door
neighbour Steve Raskin, who
did the art for our record,
Andrew from Tsunami, and this
guy John Doogen who's in, hke,
five other bands. We play kick
ass rock 'n' roll.
Does it allow you to do stuff
you can't do in Velocity Girl?
Jim: I don't know, we've
practiced hke four times, we
played one show. I haven't
exactly taken it to its ultimate
extreme yet.
Brian: Although Jim plays
guitar in dial band as opposed to
| Jim: So that's one thing it
Sallows me to do. We're doing a
Sub Pop single and then we're
recording in die fall or
whenever; it'll come out
sometime afterwards.
Biiun: Why'd you decide to go
with Sub Pop, Jim?
Jim: Because it was die path of
least resistance. Actually, a lot
of the people that we talked to
from major labels when we
were wilh Velocity Girl have,
since the Alternative Press
article, l>een calling me up a lot
so I think we're going to do
somediing on Geffen, a
soundtrack thing.
But do Ihey call you just
because you're Jim Spellman
of Velocity Girl or have they
heard the band?
Brian: Well, they know that I'm
really die backbone of Velocity
Girl.
Jim: I want to be the Phil
Collins of indie-rock - you
know, the drummer that comes
out from behind the drums to be
the #l record chart maker.
Actually, I want to be the Phil
Collins of the indie-rock scene
only as far as acting goes.
Brian: You got a lot of hair loss
logo.
Jim: I have far too much hair to
be Phil Collins.
© Most lesbians and gay men from small towns dream of fleeing the isolation and alienation of their environs and escaping to such queer-friendly
meccas as Vancouver or San Francisco, never to return. Not Jon Ginoli. Born in Peoria, Illinois, Ginoli lived in nearby Champagne until 1988 and
only moved out to California when he decided he wanted to make a living as a musician. And now, as lead singer and songwriter for San Francisco's queer-core heroes Pansy Division, he's heading back to his small town, mid-west roots, taking his in-your-face and often hilariously pro-sex,
pro-gay message to such bastions of queer consciousness as Salt Lake City, Dayton and Denver, Colorado.
"We had some gay fans at our show in Salt Lake City, but I don't think there was anybody who was queer at our show in Denver."
Ginoli's not one to be easily discouraged though. Anyone who is familiar with his work with Pansy Division knows that he has a knack for
finding the humour in any situation, especially when it's related to sex. Pansy Division's first album, Undressed, included songs about who gets to
be on top ("Versatile"), preferred penis shapes ("Curvature"), and sexual self-discovery ("The Cocksucker Club"), and their latest release on
Lookout! Records, Deflowered, carries on with this fine tradition with songs about equality in oral sex ("Reciprocate"), preferred penis sizes
("Beercan Boy"), and sexual self-stimulation ("New Pleasures"). Is Ginoli afraid that people will think he's obsessed? "Well, we just kind of do
what we do. I mean, I expect that in the future the criticism of Pansy Division will be that 'Oh God, they're still singing about sex,' which to me is
an inexhaustible topic. So I feel like we're always going to have the horny sex songs because the world needs more of them."
When I spoke with Jon he was
recuperating in San Francisco after touring the Plains of America
and the Prairies of Canada along
with instant superstars Green
Day. It may seem strange to some
that an up and coming band like
Green Day would risk losing potential fans by touring with such
a controversial act as Pansy Division, but as Jon explained, that
was all part of their master plan.
"They asked us to open their tour
because they liked us, but also because of what we sing about and
how we're confident about it.
They wanted us along so we
would irritate the element of their
audience that they don't like that
they' ve picked up recendy. That
sort of more mainstream - just
kinda boring mainstream people
who have heard them now that
they're on MTV. They thought,
'Well, we'll get Pansy Division
on there to biow their minds.' And
The band's decision to join the
Green Day tour was not an easy
one. When Pansy Division tour
on their own the people who
come to see them have, for the
most part, heard of them and
know more or less what they're
about. Such would not be the case
on the Green Day ride, especially
since much of the Green Day
audience, as Jon noted, do not
even know what that band is
aboul
"We played with Green Day
with a fair amount of trepidation
prior to the show, like 'God are
people gonna hate us.' We figured
people would love us some nights
and hate us other nights. There
were always people every night
who didn't hke us - it's the eternal fate of any opening act - but
people were going wild at some
of our shows and there were usually people there who knew who
we were. Especially down in the
mid-west in the US, there were
people who were there for us and
who said - actually there were a
few in Canada too - who said,
'Yeah I came to see you, not
Green Day.' Which, you know,
kinda surprised us."
"One of the things that was really interesting was that we were
playing to teenage audiences and
we had a really great reaction
from girls. Girls went crazy -
there were some nights where it
would be like at a Beatles show,
where the girls were going
"Aaaahhh!!!" and I think it's because -
I mean, the thing about homophobia
is that homophobia and sexism really
are the same thing, because it's that fear
of, hke, men that fear being feminized
And you know, being feminized is the
worst thing that could happen to somebody - God forbid that you would be
more like a woman - so it's that kind
of sexism that is pretty inseparable
from the issue of homophobia, and I
think that's one reason why girls were
so into us on the tour. Guys were into
us also, but there was definitely a much
more noticeable trend of girls who really embraced the message: it's gay,
but it's not macho. And, of course,
they'd never heard any body singing
about dicks like that before so it was
liberating that way."
Being the jaded soul that I am, and
despite the fact that I love Pansy Division, I had some trouble believing that
every girl, boy, women and man who
saw the band was as fond of them as I
am. When I first heard that Pansy Division were touring the Prairies and the
American mid-west, I had visions of
them being run out of town a la Easy
Rider.
"We didn't get very much heckling;
we didn't get stuff thrown at us; we
didn't get the type of negative responses you might anticipate. A good
story is in St. Louis, which was one of
the best shows, there was a guy who
was in the back who I could see who
was, like, standing in the light [and]
giving us the finger - the bird - with
both hands. This was after about the
third song [when] he finally realized
just what was going on up there. He's
in the back and he's gotta give us this
message, so he pushes lus way through
the crowd and he gets up front and he's
giving us the finger and looking real] y
nasty, and he wanders right into the
area where all of our biggest fans were.
They were dancing and mashing and
they were subdy giving him the elbow
and kicking him and just letting him
know that he wasn't welcome there -
and he shut up after tliaL The psychology of somediing like that is you get a
guy in there who thinks he can go
ahead and be violent or be abusive and
that the audience will go along with il
will sort of egg him on. And in this
case it really took the wind out of his
sails and I was really happy that it transpired that way"
"Probably the worst show was in
Calgary where about two thirds of the
crowd went out into the lobby - and
that was the first show and we were
hke'God, this is really gonna suck.'
And then the show afterwards in Ed
monton was really good and then
from then on really it's been pretty

In addition to blasting away barriers of homophobia and sexism, Pansy
Division are also touring madly so that
people will buy their new record. Con-
taining fifteen songs of pop-punk bliss,
Deflowered is a much more balanced
effort than Undressed, alternating
softer tracks such as "A Song of Re-
membrance for Old Boyfriends" with
out and out rockers such as "New
Pleasures" and "Homosapien," a resurrected version of an old Pete Shelly
tune that has a special significance for
Jon. "I'm fairly prejudiced towards
guitars and away from keyboards and
drum machines, but "Homosapien"
was the first song that I heard that I
really loved that had all that sort of programming and keyboard and drum
machine technology used with it It
made me think 'Yeah, there's nothing
wrong with technology, you just have
to find people who are creative enough
to use it well.' And I think Pete Shelly
was one of those people, even though
I loved his Buzzcocks stuff better. But
I thought the original "Homosapien"
was a great song, in part because it had
guitars on it along with all this other
stuff, so it didn't sound hke Yazoo and
Depeche Mode - button pushing music. It was originally scheduled to be
that next Buzzcocks single when they
broke up -1 would have loved to have
heard that, so it's sort of like trying to
rewrite history a hole by doing it this
Buying a dildo
So hard to decide
Extra long, extra thick, extra wide?
(from "New Pleasures")
T m still searching for the perfect one;
I'm not completely satisfied with the
%yiEJVE9A$
it I've made so, urn, I
know there's other possibilities out
there. Actually one of the greatest
things that I just saw is this feminist
sex store in San Francisco called Good
Vibrations which puts out a catalogue,
and they also put out a book. I think
it's called the Good Vibrations Guide
to Sex...or to something, something
about sex. It's a store that men and
women shop at, but it's mainly a sex
store for women and so it's got like
the cutest dildos you've ever seen.
There just these Utile silicone things
that are coloured and painted a certain
way so that they look like figures. It's
kind of expensive, though. But it's like
the cutest sex stuff you've ever seen,
it's really imaginative and wonderful.
I know they have like an international
following of people who order from it
- and it's just three blocks from my
house. I should go there more often."
Feel like I landed on another planet
Of clones with gym tits as hard as granite
Body fascists rule this land
Where can I find a flat chested man?
(From "Huffy Cky")
"I had written the song about Los
Angeles 'cause I lived there one year
and I managed to get out, but it was a
situation where the first time Pansy Division went to play down there, which
was a couple of years ago, all of us -1
mean I was the only one who had lived
there before - but all of us just stood
on a street comer in West Hollywood
looking around and then sort of looking at each other simultaneously with
this look on our faces of "Thank God
we don't li ve here.' But one of the dubs
that is put down in the song - that we
make fun of- did the strangest thing:
somebody sent me a flyer that they had
put out - just something to promote
their club that you hand out to people -
that used the lyrics to our song and a
picture of our album on it, even though
we trashed them mercilessly. It's very
strange, I guess they're masochistic
down there. Bull guess diey need publicity and it's good publicity as they
see it -1 can't figure out why else they
would use it It's very ironic"
He thinks that he's Oscar Wilde, but
he's Paul Lynde
Can't say anything good about any-
He flips his cigarette with disdain
You've failed to live up to his standards again
(from "Negative Queen")
""Negative Queen" is just like a certain type of stereotypical gay guy that
if you're gay you can get very sick of,
especially if you go to gay bars. It's
sort of a barfly type that's pretty ubiquitous no matter where you go; you'll
find them in San Francisco or pretty
much anywhere where there's queers."
"Paul Lynde was a very queeny comedian who was a TV actor in the 60's
and early 70's; he was one of the relatives on Bewitched and there was this
game show called Hollywood Squares.
He was always the one in the middle
and he was always the best one - he
was the most cutting. In retrospect I
can see that it was gay humour, but I
didn't then. I just thought he was this
wickedly funny guy who was always
making biting remarks - but they were
always of this snippy, put down kind
of nature. That is some people's favourite line on the whole record. It's something that people who aren't American probably won't get and who
weren't old enough to have seen him
on television - but you can still see Bewitched reruns."
One of the great disappointments
in many works by gay artists is the tendency to make artistic compromises in
order to present genetically positive
images of the gay community. Pansy

Division, however, do not hesitate to
criticize those factions of the gay community that they feel need to be called
down, in particular the more superficial ones.
"I' m not against muscles perse, but
just the whole conformist thing about
attaining this bodily perfection - which
is not always true but often seems to
take place at the expense of brain
power. I mean, that's a stereotype too,
and of course it's not always true, but
it's been true enough that I felt it was
worth commenting on."
Even though songs such as "Fluffy
Qty" and "Negative Queen" are more
specific to the gay experience than
much of the material on Undressed,
Jon has no worries about alienating
potential fans who may not be able to
pick up on the more subtle references
and meanings in the songs. After touring with Green Day and playing to pre-
dominantly teenage audiences, he discovered that even the kids who were
too young to get into bars - gay or
straight - and who couldn't possibly
understand what all the songs were
about were still digging the band.
"Our audience is a lot younger than
we thought it would be, both when we
started out and after the record started
selling. We sold our t-shirts next to
Green Day's t-shirts and they kept a
mailing list and on their mailing list
they asked everybody who was signing up to list there age. So, you know,
there's hardly anyone at these shows
r twenty. So that was really interesting - it was sort of like doing
outreach to a younger crowd. But even
playing our own shows there was a
younger crowd then I expected, which
-real 'cause we're obviously over
twenty-one and we thought that we
would probably have more appeal to
people who had been around the gay
world a while - enough to be pissed
off at the choices out there and feel like
gay rock and roll is something that
they've been waiting for. So our audi-
e is larger than we thought it would
be among younger people - and
straighter too. I have this feeling that
a few years I'm going to be getting
letters from people who said 'Yeah, I
heard your record when I was fifteen
or sixteen and it really helped me come
L "Cause I know that's how it would
have been for me if I had heard it back
at that age."
It's obvious by the inclusion of a list
of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth
groups in the liner notes for
Deflowered that Pansy Division take
their role as icons for queer young peo-
I pie fairly seriously, but that doesnt
lecessarily mean that they will seek
o address this portion of dieir audi-
snee more directly in their music In
fact, the way things are shaping up the
next Pansy Division album will be a
much more (forgi ve me) mature record
than anytlling they've done so far.
"What I've written are a lot more
land of serious minded songs, sort of
like "Luck Of the Draw" from the first
album or "Negative Queen." If were
to record the next album right now it
would be a fairly serious affair and I
don't really want to have a whole album full of songs like that. So I think
what we'll probably do is write some
more and end up with a more balanced
record. I've just been kind of writing
about the sniff I've seen around me
lately and seems like I know a lot of
people who are in relationships or falling out of them. I'm still single, so it's
not autobiographical. There's one song
mat we left off of the new album'cause
it was actually a bitter song. I think
there'll be an increasing variety of
viewpoints and moods and that kind
of thing."
Whatever the next album sounds
like, Ginoli is certain it will be just as
queer and in your face as its two predecessors. In the meantime, however,
Pansy Division will be putting out a
collection of all of their singles as well
as releasing three new singles, the first
of which is a Prince cover called "Jack
U Off' that is now out on eMpTy
Records. Following that will be a duet
with Calvin of Beat Happening on an
old Nancy Sinatra song (out on K
Records), and then a new mix of
"James Bondage" backed with covers
of Liz Phair and Joe Jackson. Given
the success of the Green Day tour, I
was curious as to whether Pansy Division were content to record and release
their music through independents or
did they have major label aspirations.
I was assured that, for the time being
at least, Pansy Division wouldn't be
playing ball in the so-called big
leagues.
"The whole major label issue right
now is a big one on the indie scene
'cause so much of the indie scene's
kinda either graduated or gotten bought
up. I'm not totally against the major
label thing but I think it's wrong for
us; I think we'll get lost in the shuffle
really quickly. I don't see us as being
commercial enough that we would be
a top priority or a high enough priority
that we would really get the benefits
of what a major label can bring. I mean,
Green Day are a perfect example of
why it's not always bad to sign with a
major label - it's gone as well as you
could imagine it could go for an indie
band by them signing with Warner -1
think they' ve sold a million copies now.
I would not have guessed it possible
before it happened. But a band like us,
I think we'd get lost in the shuffle.
There's so many different levels of
how a record company works; there's
accountants and then there's promotions and there's the A&R people who
sign you - it's like they might sign you
but you have to go through this whole
other process to actually get out there
and start selling. And I think for a band
like us we just make too many people
queasy to make the whole process
work right. I wouldn't say never, but I
would really like us to become a really popular indie band in the way that
somebody like the Jesus Lizard still are
or the Butthole Surfers are - or were
before they got signed - but it's like
that's how I feel. We have a long way
to go before we would think about that,
but I do think that we could become
popular and have a lot of people like
us. I think we're a good band."
Unlike many of the bands who
played - or didn't play - at Music West
in May, Pansy Division feel that they
benefited from their involvement with
the festival. After seeing the band play
at the glaringly inappropriate Automotive, I expected to hear another tale of
woe bemoaning the intrinsic evilness
of an industry circle-jerk, but, no such
luck. Jon assured me that he made
some good contacts - including one
that will be bringing Pansy Division
to Australia next spring - and credits
the festival for allowing the band to
play Canada for the first time. Since
their first two appearances during
Music West, Pansy Division have
played three other gigs in Vancouver
and Jon is looking forward to coming
back for more. He compares Vancouver favourably to San Francisco and
even suggested the possibility of mov-
"We actually like Vancouver a lot;
we have friends there now and Chris,
our bass player, has a boyfriend, a long
term boyfriend, who wants to actually
move to Vancouver. So who knows,
we may be local one of these days."
Oooh, imagine the
possibilities...cornmando raids on the
Odyssey to smash all their Celine Dion
records, punk rock shows at
Celebrititcs...a veritable revolution! I
can only hope.
In the nearer and more realistic future, Pansy Division will be appearing
at the Town Pump on September 7th,
finally getting a chance to play at what
Jon refers to as the 'legendary' Town
Pump. Recalling the last time I was
there and the argument that I got into
with the bartender about the warm, flat
beer he had served me, I wondered
what could possibly be legendary
about the place.
"Oh, you know, because it's been
around for so long diat you hear about
it and it's like 'Oh yeah, Town Pump,
everybody's played there.' It's like,
'WeD good, I want to be part of everybody!"*
Fair enough, I suppose. But then
who am I to talk - the last real show I
saw at the Pump was Suede. I even
admitted this fact to Jon, and, thankfully, he forgave me. It wasn't just that
I was embarrassed because Suede are
completely lacking in originality, but
also because of Brett Anderson's
asexual gay pose. Fortunately, Jon
knew exactly what I was talking about
"I really tried to like Suede but I just
find them really pretentious. And even
though I like a few of their songs they
still make me roll my eyes. I don't hate
them though. Our bass player does, but
I'm just really tired of the sort of half
way pose, like 'We'll flirt with ambiguous sexuality but we won't actually do
it.' Their drummer's openly gay but
he's not the focus. I don't discount
them totally, but the thing that just gets
me is they just want to be rock stars in
the worst possible way and it just rubs
me the wrong way."
Without realizing that I may have
actually been coming to the defence
of Suede, I suggest that their attitude
towards fame has a lot to do with the
whole way the British music scene operates with its whirlwind cycle of valorization and damnation and its emphasis on style over substance.
"Wen, I think that's why the British music scene has declined drastically in importance around the world:
there's just not that many interesting
British bands anymore, though there
seems to be just as many British
records coming out It's kind of sad the
way their scene is so insular over there
that what becomes important in England has little relevance to the rest of
the world. I remember when all my
favourite bands used to be British and
now none of them are. WeD, actually,
two of them are, but they're both pretty
much hated in England - The Mekons
and The Fall. They're bands that have
nothing to do with the trends that go
on over there. Actually, Britain's sort
of frustrating for me because I spent a
month this year trying to get people
over there interested in putting our
record out and failed. It's a weird place:
they' ve got homosexual pop stars over
there, you know, like Boy George and
Jimmy Sommerville and Andy Bell,
but they all do dance music. 1 think in
some ways people over there are going to have a more blase attitude towards us, like 'Oh we already had
Frankie Goes To Hollywood, so you're
talking about being gay?' You know,
it's like 'yawn.' It's just a weird cultural blend between here and there, so
I' m not too worried about it I' m just a
little disappointed that there aren't
r there inter-
While the band has yet to have
a record released in England, they
do plan to play there sometime in
the future anyways and, in the
meantime, they will be going to
Australia and New Zealand. The
Australian music press has been
good to them and they're record has
been distributed well ("I still think
that means they've sold 250 copies...") so that particular tour is one
they are looking forward to. As for
their up-coming tour of Canada,
Pansy Division will be playing
coast to coast, from Victoria to our
new hotbed of talent, Halifax. Ap-
parendy Pansy Division had an opportunity to open for Sloan and
Sloan turned them down, but there
don't seem to be any hard feelings:
"Maybe we should learn a Sloan
song so they'll like us."
With almost all of my questions
answered before I ever got a
chance to ask them, I had just two
filial points to bring up before I said
good-bye to Mr. Ginoli:
The first time I saw you was at the
Lux during Music West and the
whole night I just had this huge grin
on my face; it was just like 'Wow,
someone's finally saying this and
they're totally rockin' - mashing
to "Smells Like Queer Spirit" was,
like, a definitive moment. But you
don't play that song any more, I
Yeah, we don't play it anymore.
We had a very bad reaction to it in
Seattle, and maybe that was partly
because [it was] Seattle, but after
Cobain died we tried our best to
explain why we were doing the
song - but some people are just to
thick to get it That, coupled with
the fact that we had pretty much
decided to quit doing it before he
died: It was done at the time partly
as a comment on a song that was
popular right then and I think it still
works, but we have a lot of other
songs now. We did it for a reason
and that reason sort of ran its course
- you can still buy the record
Last question - where do you get
your go-go dancers from? Are they
local or do you bring them with
/e. go-go dancers in San
Weonlyhav
Francisco...
But two of the times when you
played in Vancouver you had, not
really a go-go dancer, but you had
the bunny boy who came out..
Yeah, the bunny boy is., is Wozzle.
He's like, I guess, this infamous
queer punk boy scenester in Vancouver. He had contacted us about
playing up there before we were
ever able to go up, so I had known
him before and had no idea he was
such a cutie. When I met him it
was like 'Oh boy, we need a boy
like you to come go-godance' and
he was happy to. So yeah, if any
of your readers are interested in go-
go dancing we don't take them on
the road - so we do accept volun-

Shepherd's bed,
so the mic
phone didn't
anything he
had to say at
first. Our
Swimming
Dog. The name has a fairly
literal explanation. Ever seen
a dog swim? It's pretty
wicked, isn't it? Pure
survival. There's nothing
halfway about it.
Wicked Swimming Dog
are a Vancouver-based three
piece featuring Paul Shepherd
on drums, Chris Reid on bass
and Jeff Fagoaga (pronounced Fow-agga) on
guitars and vocals. They
make 'rock music', for lack
of a better term, sort of like
Hendrix and the Doors
crossed with Neil Diamond
and Tom Jones crossed with
everything cool that's
happened since, from Bad
Brains to the Cocteau Twins.
Shepherd and Reid keep the
groove heavy and dangerous
and Fagoaga takes care of
everything else. Their songs
have texture and beauty and
moments of real fragility, but
mostly they come on hard and
loud.
The Dogs have released
one CD (1992's From Here To
Your Garden) and a new
seven-inch is due any day.
They've toured and gigged
extensively, including a few
trips down the west coast as
far as L.A. Future plans
include a full North American
swath this fall.
I spoke to the three
members of Wicked Swimming Dog in a crowded 10 x
10 bedroom on a muggy
Friday night with cheap red
wine, beer and eventually
gin. Shepherd and Fagoaga
were sitting on either side of
an amp that served as a table
-/iih Black
Eyed Buddha and Damn The
Diva at the Town Pump:
Fagoaga: It was an amazing
show. We played "Sweet
Home Alabama."
Shepherd: ...we were pissing
people off. It was a combination between me having
"Cock Rules" written in giant
letters on my chest...and
Jeff's pants falling down.
Fagoaga: It was my frontman
position all in all.
Shepherd: It was the ambiguous sexuality of the whole
performance. People couldn't
understand the irony of it,
and then Fagoaga went on
raving about the apocalypse.
Fagoaga: I have an apocalyptic Wicked Swimming Dog
speech that I pull out...
Discorder: Which is what?
Fagoaga: Pre, post and during
the apocalypse, fifty thousand years of hell on
earth...(mumbles something
incomprehensible).
Shepherd: I think that
Fagoaga is influenced by
UFOs.
Fagoaga: It's not UFOs.
Look, all that matters is that I
know that Wicked Swimming
Dog, this project, is going to
be the last great sheet that's
brought over everybody
before the end of the world:
we're the biggest influence
that's going to happen before
everyone dies, or things
change. I know that. And it's
not a band anymore, it's
beyond that; it's not an
influence, it's a lifestyle. It's
going to happen and that's it,
it was in the Bible.
There's a wicked swimming
dog in the Bible?
The discussion gels
interrupted here by Shepherd's fortuitous discovery
of a glass of wine he
misplaced a few hours
earlier. Reid has climbed
down from the loft by now
and they begin comparing
notes on how much they've
all had to drink thus far this
evening. Not too much. It's
about 11 pm and nobody's
slurring...yet.
How did you guys meet?
Fagoaga: I met Shepherd
through the Georgia
Straight. I don't remember
tlie first lime I met Reid.
Shepherd: It was that time
we went back to Calgary,
Fagoaga: Was I wasted?
Ren): Don't even bother
asking that question if the
story's after I "77.
Fagoaga: Yeah, ever since
b'lvis died.,.
Shepherd: And Star Wars
came out. Real ami I have
known each other for a long
tune, but we didn't talk back
then.
Rent: You were an asshole.
Shepherd: Was I?
Real: It was that night with
the acid:
Shepherd: Thai's right, I did
(his crazy acid. I took il
figuring it was nothing
special and next thing I
knew, I was so high • and
then to pull it all together, 1
sniffed cocaine, and this
was in Calgary and there
was all these little teenage
drug dealers running around
and, man, I thought I was in
Havana, and then I had a
bad trip...
Reid: I brought you down
though. I helped pull it all
together. I'd just come out
of the bathroom, I'd snorted
this kid's pure cocaine and I
was on fire, and Paul comes
up and grabs me and goes,
"Man, man, I - I think I'm
in Havana, are we in
Havana right now? Jesus,
I'm losing my mind." So I
calmed him down.
Shepherd: With this
statement: "Man, you're not
in grade nine, would you
pull it together? It's only
acid. If you're wigging out,
do some cocaine."
Reid: I went to Peach Fest a
few years ago and took all
this acid and a riot broke
out, and these guys asked
me it I wanted my jaw
broken. But then they went
off chasing this other kid,
so I ran as fast as I could
and did a fuckin' wicked
flying kick and totally
caved the whole door in on
the side of their Camaro.
Would you say you v
possessed by punk rock at
this point?
Fagoaga; No, it
passion.
Is that the name of your
new release, Cock Passion'!
Shepherd: Nah, it's Fruit,
Sex <£ Tinkerbell, A seven
inch. Two songs: "Ink" and
"Top Love luck."
Cettlnj. back to this m Us*
we*k, did people actually
hate you?
Reid: Fifty-fifty. There was
Jove on one side of the room,
and on the other, it looked
like we were playing for pro
wrestlers   But after we hit
that Skynard number, we had
'em. Then it was-all love.
Fagoaga; 1 kept speaking
about death and the apocalypse of our band. And (hen i
was shooting my water gun
off at everyone and I'm
dancing and my pubic hairs
were showing. And then
everyone lost then minds.
Let's talk about the song
writing process,
Fagoaga: What we do is we
start by beheading a chicken
and we feel the dark force*
tugging at our toes. The** w<;
gather together small Objects
and other things that have to
be [accounted for) when we
do our ritual sacrifices, which
other thaa chickens can
include Vogue models from
the 1970s - which is really
heavy because we're not into
violence. Then we drink
blood,
An argument  breaks out as to
what music should be put on
the stereo. Reid's latest
home-made mixed tape wins
out. It features Mark
Lanegan, Sly and the Family
Stone, the Ramones, Jimi
Hendrix, Myles Davis, Neil
Diamond, Otis Redding, The
Jesus and Mary Chain and
much, much more. The
conversation turns to talk of
role models and
infix
Shepherd: Jane Eyre's my
igoaga: Actually, I have no
role models except for
myself.
How about when you sing?
Shepherd: Joni Mitchell,
maybe a little Tom Jones...
Reid: And Sammy Davis Jr.
:-r:'" *
Reid: I'd have to say the Rat
Pack are pretty much our role
models: Frank Sinatra.
Sammy Davis Jr., Dean
Martin, Joey Bishop...
Shepherd: Shirley Macl.aine
and Aiigie Dickinson, too -
the only two chicks who ever
made it into the Rat Pack.
They wanted John F,
Kennedy, too, but Sinatra's
ties with the Mafia made that
possibility kind of rough.
Reid: Yeah, Kennedy was a
swinger, lie knew how to
party.
Shepherd; If they got
Kennedy, the strength of the
Rat Pack would've been
Reid; Can you imagine
Sammy as vice-president?1''
Fagoaga: Dude, what you
don't understand is [that] the
Rat Pack controls everything
Still, the legacy continues,
lis got into mind control -
they went inlo the race for
the microwave control
between the Soviets...but
they publicly announced in
1086 they were five years
ahead of the Soviets with
microwave mind control; they
don'l need direct control of
the bram, ihey can just send
Reid: Alright, stop the tape
while we sedate him.
Fagoaga: It's stuff you cannot
see but it's beyond coloured
glass, I'll tell you that.
Sheperd: '80s punk rock.
Hard core. That's a role
model.
Name some names.
Reid: The Faction,
Aggression, Beyond
Possession, Black Flag,
[£-* Circle Jerks...
Fagoaga: Early Corey
Hart before he
e had a mole
in the middle of his
forehead, and he was
this total
and I told everybody he was my
dad.
Reid: All my role
models are black.
I've got kind of
problem.
Shepherd: Come clean,
Fagoaga, who the hell
were you listening to in
the '80s?
Fagoaga: Jimi Hendrix
and the Doors. I swear to
God f never owned any
Zeppelin...
Reid: Thai's a lie. You
know he had "HASH"
written on his jean jacket:
"SMOKE COLOMBIAN.
KONA BUDS"
Shepherd: Tell me a
fifteen pack of Kokanee
wasn't your primary
influence...
Fagoaga: My only two
role models are my dad
and Jimi Hendrix, but
actually, you know who
my new role model is?
She's got a sort of
anonymous edge. Reniem
ber when Ihose women
used lo come to your door
and sell ("lairol and makeup...
Reid: Avon.
Fagoaga: Right, Avon,
those ladies...
Let's talk about the
music. Why does il
matter? Given the fact
that there's more rock
bunds in the world right
now than there's ever
been, why should anyone
care about Wicked
Swimming Dog?
Shepherd: The thing is,
man/it doesn't matter,
that's the point: who gives
a goddamned rat's ass?
You need something to
do. You need something to
occupy your time and
what better way to do it
than play loud. At the
same time, we are not
contrived. And we do
have the element of self-
parody.
Fagoaga Everything we
do, we do it together. We
go on stage, we don't plan
anything.  Everything we
do on stage is what we do
in our basement suites;
but I don't live in the
basement anymore, I've
done my time. Shepherd
claims that I went insane
for two years because of a
girl, but I went insane
because I lived in a two-
tone brown basement
suite in North Van. The
only pleasure I got was
skateboarding and
drinking, and then I tried
to combine the two sports
and I sprained my ankle.
You see, people shouldn't
combine sports.
At this point talk turned
to sports and the recent
spectacular television
death of Ayrton Senna,
then, inevitably, to the
death of Kurt Cobain. The
Dogs concur that it was a
horrible waste. If only
he'd gotten into karate
like Elvis...

Tkat's always difficult. 3 tkink
we're getting better at it as time

3f you missed tke Bourbons on

tkis fall and bet on tkem bringing Alright, I know what you are thinking. Last month Trish took out Grant
Lawrence, now she's offed Vancouver Special's Kim Kinakin. This girl
is on a rampage, she's cleaning
house! I know that is what you are
thinking, but you are wrong. The
fact that I am filling in for Kim is
completely unrelated to the Grant
Lawrence incident. You see, I took
the Seven Inch column from Grant,
but Kim gave me his column for this
month. Why, you ask? Was he afraid
that he was the next to go down?
Did he surrender his column in exchange for his life? No. The truth
is, Kim is just really nice.
Not many 'zines have come out in
Vancouver this month, hardly any
new releases, and only a few good
shows. The horrible heat that has
been driving me nuts all month
could be to blame for this musical
dry spell. Hopefully, now that the
summer is coming to a close, we
will see more good stuff from a
cooler, happier Vancouver scene.
Trish On Being Nice
I always try to be optimistic about
things and music is not an exception. How are things ever going to
get better if we expect them to get
worse? For example, let's pretend
that we are a local band and we
don't feel that we are getting the
local support that we need. What
would be the most effective strategy for getting more support?
Should we a) stop playing our music because we must suck; b) get
interviews in out-of-city magazines
and slag our own city and it's scene;
or c) put into our shows the energy
that we want out of them? Duh. If
we look at the most popular bands
in Vancouver, we will notice that the
people who make the music, regardless of it being hardcore,
cuddlecore, or indie rock are very
nice. The fact is, scenes are small
and personal and in order to succeed
a band needs to be personable, cub,
Pluto, and Spar kmarker are proof of
this. With much relief, I say that bad
people finish last.
Now that I have explained the
laws of the rock universe I can get
on with my reviews.
Pebble
(cassette)
As if I'm not excited by any band
that puts a cute little kitty cat on the
cover of their demo! Pebble has
been around Vancouver for some
months now, playing at Crosstown
Traffic and the South Wall so frequently that they could be considered the house band. They are a
three piece hardcore outfit from the
bowels of East Van. This tape is
hardcore with a difference; these
boys know their shit. It is nice to
see accomplished musicians doing
hardcore because they take it a step
further. Interesting drum patterns,
amazing metalish guitar and steady
bass. (#1-1338 Commercial Dr.,
Van.,BCV5L3X6)
Gloriosa
(demo)
This is a three song demo from another Commercial Drive band. Indie
rock of the more bland kind. Sounds
like many other bands I have heard
lately. I didn't find it painful to listen to, but it could use some work
in the originality department. The
vocals remind me of a conservative
Pansy Division, the guitar sounds
hke Grover and the drums aren't
that exciting. (#4-1965 Commercial
Drive, Van., BCV5N4A8)
Hunting Humans
(cassette)
Hunting Humans! That isn't very
nice! This release by four boys has
heavy guitar by someone who
calls himself Murch, a Dan on
bass, a Dave on drums and a
Rodney on vocals. The first comparison that springs into my head
is Strain. If you heard this tape,
you would be surprised at how
Hunting Humans manages to
bridge the gap between Strain and
the early eighties new wave movement. (64 E. 6th, Van., BC V5T
1J4)
Team Dresch
(7")
Yeah, it isn't from Vancouver, but
it is so rad! Team Dresch is the
new girl All-Star band on Kill
Rock Stars. It consists of Donna
from Chainsaw 'zine and Candy
Ass Records, Kaia from Adickdid
and Jody from Hazel. Now do you
understand why this rules? Beau
tiful vocals, especially on "Molasses in January." I can't say it
enough, but this is so pretty. (PO
Box 1151, Olympia, WA 98507-
1151 or PO Box 42382, Portland, OR 97242)
Visual
I am a 'zine junkie. Nothing
in this world makes me happier than picking up new
'zines. I try to Scratch
Records at least once a week
to see if anyone has made a
new issue or started a whole
new 'zine. I also write away
for 'zines all over North
America. I always have
'zines on hand. I think that
'zines are great. 'Zines are a
great way of communicating
and creating a community. I
have pen pals all over Canada
because of my 'zine Random
Thoughts, and I know I've made
a lot of people happy by filling
their boxes too. The following
people write cool publications and
could use your postal support:
Face #5
Aral Griffen has been doing this
'zine for what seems like a very
long time. I first picked it up at a
show in Bellingham and have
been lucky enough to have the opportunity to read almost every issue. What sticks out most about
this 'zine is Aral's ability to thoroughly examine a topic. Each issue includes an essay or part of
one on such topics as eating disorders. Her cover promises an "In
Depth Interview" with a band
called Botan Rice Candy and she
delivers - thirteen pages! Send this
girl stamps or money you cheap
bastards! (93569 Mt. Baker Hwy.,
Bellingham WA 98226)
Silent Subversion #5
These White Rock kids just keep
spitting out issues of their 'zine.
They make new 'zines like other
people make dirty laundry. That
means often. I liked the interview
with a local hairdresser. The tone
of these 'zine occasionally borders
on preachy, with articles called
"Integrity" and "Solidarity." Some
stuff is good though, like the piece
on one writer's parents. Worth
picking up. Once again, cheapos,
send a stamp. (14977-22nd Ave.,
White Rock, BCV4A9J2)
Rain or Shine
This is a beautifully laid out 'zine
by a very tough girl named Kat. She
has had some tough times in her life
and uses her 'zine to work through
the rough spots. Her layout is great
and the tone ranges from very innocent to the perspective of a girl
who has seen more than she wants
to. (#301-2950 Heather St., Vancouver, BC V5Z 3J8)
Handle Fresh Boys." I love people
from the South, they have the best
vocabulary. You can also get a good
little introduction to the famed Austin scene. This 'zine is very poetic.
My favourite line is "Impatience is
my favourite trick to lock you out
and throw your face away." Write
to Paul at PO Box 3231, Austin, TX
78764-3231.
Crash #2
This is a very cool 'zine from
Seattle. It is a computer generated,
high quality thing that very much
resembles a magazine more than the
kind of 'zine I'm used to. It isn't
many pages, but what is in inside is
would like it as much as I do, but I
love the music selection. They interview Beck, the Tourettes, Pin-
head Gunpowder, and Slim Moon
of the Kill Rock Stars label. It is free
in the North West and a dollar
twenty-five elsewhere. (1202 E.
Pike St. Seattle Wa, 981222-3934)
Pool Dust #22
When I first saw this I thought about
all the apathetic skateboarders that
I know who don't do anything except skate, and I was stoked on the
idea of someone doing something.
Then, as I opened the back page, I
saw two ads for skateboarding companies that included pictures of naked women. First of all, I'd like to
call the two companies on their
choice of ads: Street Rod and Smut
Skateboards, you suck. I get so angry when I see these ads because
they alienate girls from these stores.
And I have just as much right as a
boy to feel comfortable in any store
I go into. Secondly, I'd hke to call
this 'zine on their poor choice of
sponsors. Pool Dust, you suck. How
does this 'zine expect me to read the
rest of their work if I immediately
feel like I am being told I am not
equal or welcome? Even if the rest
of the 'zine is good, which it isn't, I
still wouldn't be able to read it hke
a boy would. Women's bodies don't
sell skateboards. Maybe the writers
of this 'zine, being from Grunge
City and all, are so used to exploitation that they are blind to their exploitation of women, but they
should know better. Oh, and by the
way, I really don't care to see pictures of people smoking hash in a
'zine. Jerks. (PO Box 85664, Seattle
WA 98145-1664)
1 wish 1 knew about all-ages shows
in Vancouver, but I'm working so
much these days that I have no idea
who is playing where. Some
scenester 1 am! Oh, except that
Girlapalooza will be happening in
mid-September. Well, you are welcome to write me with any information for October. I know that
Lync should be touring this way in
the fall. Oh, my fluttering heart!
Until then folks, take care.

© Hey kids, I'm back! One diousand
apologies for missing last month's
column! I was away on tour with
my rock band, so thanks to Trish
for listenin' and writin' in my absence. My mailbox was stuffed
with the goods when I got back, so
without further ramble, let's rock!
First the locals...is it just me or
do Vancouver bands pick the most
gawd-awful names on this planet?
Cringers like Jazzberry Ram, Cozy
Bones and Psychotic Jamnation all
spring to mind, as does the first
subject for review this month:
Wicked Swimming Dog. What the
hell kind of name is that? I picture
three bangers smoking love-weed
by a lake, trippin' out while watching some golden retriever fetch
sticks, and then immediately forming a metal band. That, sadly, is basically what WSD's Fruit, Sex and
Tinkerbell EP is all about. Both
songs, "Top Love Fuck" and "Ink,"
are masturbatory Pearl Jam/Led
Zeppelin bullshit. If someone can
show me something good on this
record I'll give them a dollar, because honestly people, this flangy
metal crud deserves no place on 7"
vinyl! (Dealer's Choice - 837
Keefer St..Vancouver, BC V6A
1Y8)
With unanticipated fondness 1
share with you Ten Days Late and
their new record Go With the Flow.
I expected nothing but more generic metal, but the aside's "Getaway" is a fast, upbeat, poppy-
punky song played with zesty,
much appreciated energy. "Death
Reggae" is more in die ska-metal
framery and ends the debut nicely.
Do I need to mention that this band
is made up of five women? I don't
think so. (Klark Records - Box
#162, 916 W. Broadway, Vancouver, BCV5Z 1K7)
Victoria's Mexican Power Authority are back widi the follow-
up to dieir superb debut 7" wilh a
split single widi Insult to Injury,
another all-female Vancouver
group. MPA go head-long nuts on
this one, cramming in eight songs
of crazy-ass bullshit punk that
touches on all of rock's genres.
"Car Alarm" stands out as die instant-radio-hit, though Ihe two second long "Deviated Septum" is a
close second. Another great MPA
effort. Insult to Injury is just that,
with four songs of furiously fast,
juvenile hardcore. Although I usually appreciate a litde more melody
in my blitzkrieg, this is a stripped-
down, well done recording. Kudos
on the package to - tons of stuff to
read on both bands. (Break Even
Records - 2185 Amity Dr., Sidney,
BCV8L1B2)
It seems as though the old guys
are taking after the young'uns
when it comes to putting out their
product on vinyl. Take Vancouver
supergroup The
Beauticians for example. Featuring Van-
from the Hard Rock
Miners, Knock Down
Ginger, Bob's Your
Uncle and the Smugglers, Ihe Beauticians
saw what the kids
were digging and got
busy with their very
own piece of golden
wax. Fronted by every
man's man Beez, the
Beautician's music is,
no bones about it,
quirky. Made up of
two fiddles, guitar,
bass, drums, and a
lotta vocal arrangements, the Beauticians
neatly come off as a neo-folk,
Beatles-esque beatnik comedy
troupe. But that's just Ihe a-sides's
"Getting Stronger." The flip side's
"Body Awake" is a hauntingly
quiet song, filled with Lou
Reedisms which are enunciated
fully when the band bursts into the
Velvet Underground's "We're
Gonna Have a Real Good Time
Together." The vocals are a bit
much at times, but other than that,
a nice alternative to the punk
sludge that dominates the 7" format. (Cheemo Records - #45-345
E. Broadway, Vancouver, BC VST
1W5)
At the polar opposite to Ihe
Beauticians, Sparkmarker has released two of three singles paying
tribute to artists the 'Marker admire. The first is Scallon, a three-
songer put out by Germany's Heart
First which honours the photographic wonders of Ottawa resident Shawn Scallon. Three free-
form super rockers are included
here, with the highlight on each
being Ryan's increasingly powerful throat. This boy can sing, kids.
Is he really leaving Ihe band? The
second 7" is Atomos, released by
Florida's No Idea Records, and it
is a tip o' the cap to local artist/
DiSCORDER art-guy Mark Pilon
wilh three more songs of the sonic
Sparkmarker stomp. Both records
are highly recommended. (Heart
First - Bockstr. 39 10967, Berlin
Germany. No Idea - P.O. Box
14636, Gainesville, FL, USA
32604-4636)
The bigger these Vancouver
bands get, the faster they leave
home. The cub gals have made
their first jaunt out of Canada and
onto Spain's Munster Records for
a one-off double 7" pack entitled
All Kindsa Girls, featuring girl
bands from four different countries, cub represents us well with
the buzz-pop speed of "Your Bed"
and a cover of the Velvet Underground's "Sticking with You," but
Germany's Lemon Babies hail
strongest with their brand of sugary-sweet '60's doo-wop. California's Mini Skirt Mob offer generic
hard garage a la the Pandoras, and
Scotland's Pink Cross spit ugly
Limey lo-fi molasses. (Munster
Records - P.O. Box 18107, Madrid, Spain 28080)
No matter how dark, clouded,
jaded and tired I tend to get about
bands like Pink Cross and the
mountains of musical frisbees that
surround me, I always have a warm
place in my heart for Ska, 'cuz let's
face it, it's got the beat. Victoria's
Pressure Cooker have prepared an
extremely rockin' ska-punk debut
7" in the awesome tradition of Operation Ivy and other visionaries
who have bridged the gap between
two happening genres of rock. Slap
diis checkered slab on the mat and
prepare to dance, brothers and sisters! (Stinkin' Agnes Records -
P.O. Box 8552, Victoria, BC V8W
3S2)
My other favourite Victoria
group, Bum, are at it again with
their second 7" release in the UK.
This time it's a split single with hke
minded Belgian popsters
Innerface. Bum's cut, "Resolution
#1 21" is a mid-tempo Rob Nesbitt
power ballad lhat may have been a
bit better suited to the mid-point on
an album rather than the a-side of
a single - nonetheless, it's another
good Bum tune, as well as the unexpected swan-song for singer/guitarist Nesbitt as he has permanenUy
quit the Bum. Innerface do two
songs pretending to be a sparkly
clean Descendants in lhat tried and
tired power-pop way. (First Strike
- 53 Mesnes St., Wigan, England
WN1 1QX)
And now two from dust-bowl
central, Calgary. First is a new one
by the instro-boys Huevos
Rancheros, who dish up two
smokin' originals (no Link
Wray - rejoice!) about
young bees and girls from
Nanaimo. Just about the
bestest, punkest mexicali
stuff I've heard from 'em
yet. (Top Drawer - 1912
Franklin Ave. E., Seattle,
WA, USA 98102)
Definite contenders for
the best legs in rock V roll
(sorry Huevos), Pussy
monster could be
Calgary's answer to the
Muffs, albeit with more of
a Stooges/Motorcity punk
drive to them. Very ripping
stuff - my only complaint
is that the lead vocals are
a tad too cryptic pour moi.
(Roto-flex - P.O. Box
64252, Calgary, AB T2K
6J1)
The Northwest's premier rock
'n' roll band The Fall-Outs are
back again with a stellar single on
Steve Turner's Super Electro
Records. The aside's "Sleep" is a
Benzedrine punk burst and the b-
side's "It's a Shame" - along with
the new danceland hit "Talk" - deter none neidier. Aconsistendy excellent band.
Also on Super Electro is a curve
ball by The Well water Conspiracy
which proves diat the label does not
suffer from tunnel vision. Three
songs of strange psuedo-
psychadelia circa '69. I'll stick with
the Fall-Outs, thanks. (Super
Electro Records - P.O. Box 20401,
Seatde.WA, USA 98102)
Fellow Seatde ghurus die Young
Fresh Fellows have re-entered die
ring, this time milking their '89 hit
"Go Go Gorilla" (an Ideals cover
from the early '60's) by issuing a
'by-fan demand' spin-off single of
gorilla songs. The a-side hosts the
demented whooping of "It's Gorilla
Time," backed on the flip by a cover
of tlie Ideals' follow up to "Go Go
Gorilla," the inspirational tear-
jerker "Mo'Gorilla." Hilarious and
at all times out of control. And hey
monkeys, this may be the last we
hear from the mighty Fellows for
awhile. Tlie rock' n'roll rumour mill
reports that lead singer Scott
McCaughey has joined...get
lhis...REM (!!!) for the rhydim guitar duties! You read it here first! I
wonder if we'll hear "Mo' Gorilla"
on REM's next world tour? (Telstar
Records - P.O. BOX 1123,
Hoboken, NJ, USA 07030)
Every once in a while they'll be
a record diat's completely different.
It'll have nothing to do with ape-
dances, and at times nodiing to do
with rock what so ever...and
chances are it may be from the bastards at Atnarillo Records. Whether
it be dieir prank phone call records,
or stuff from their own band Ihe Zip
Code Rapists, one is usually in for
an original ride. New from
Amarillo is a comedy 7" entitled
Looking for Laughs by stand-up
comic Neil Hamburger. The a-
side documents a live show with I
Neil telling terrible, pathetic jokes
to a very empty room; the b-side is
a radio interview that eventually
spirals into a paid advertisement
for chronic, uncontrollable urination. The back cover includes his
grueling tour schedule and a thank
you to his probation officer for
making Ihe record possible. Hysterical for its existence. (Amarillo
- P.O. Box 24433, San Francisco,
CA, USA 94124)
Sticking wilh comedy records
for the time being, Who fans are
bound to either praise or puke over |
New York City's Vital Music label's new 7" release of Tommy in
Seven Minutes. Over sixteen bands
are compiled to rudely tackle tunes
from the world's first rock opera,
with input ranging from the famed
Alice Donut and The Lunachicks
to NYC obscurities hke Dog Bowl <
and Iron Prostrate. Of course it's
pretty hilarious and over the top,
and, of course, a must-possess. (Vital Music - P.O. Box 20247, New
York, NY, USA 10028-0052)
Back to serious indie-rock, The
Softies are Rose Melburg's first .
musical outing since the break-up
of her Tiger Trap. She's parred the
new group down to a two-woman
ensemble of herself and friend Jen
on the twin electric guitars, creating a quiet buzz perfect on the ears.
The duo strum through four '50's-
style pop songs accented by Rose I
and Jen's extremely angelic voices
and in doing so create a very nice
record that will stay at the top of
the pile for weeks to come.
(Slumberland - P.O. Box 14731,
Berkeley, CA, US A 94712)
Rose is also in a band called Go
Sailor which, among other things,
features San Francisco's elf-like
mentor Paul Curran, boss of Take-
A-Day Records. Take-A-Day's latest release is from Pinhead Gunpowder, a band which hails from
the ever-fertile Berkeley music
scene. It seems that whenever |
Berkeley bands like Green Day or
Rancid move on and up there's always another group of melody-
punks to fill in the gap at Gilman
Street, and this time it sounds like
it's gonna be Pinhead Gunpowder.
As a special point of interest, this
band features Comet Bus author <
Aaron on drums, vocals, and song
writing, so one may consider this
a short, musical version of that
prime travel 'zine. (Take-A-Day -
P.O. Box 190054, San Francisco,
CA, USA 94119)
And finally there's The Crabs <
from Eugene, Oregon. The Crabs
are another two piece band, with
Lisa on drums and John on guitar;
it's love-rock, K style. They've
ditched their once dominant
marineland theme for the more
common minimalistic relationship
rock, which sorta depressed me. I
'Twas a shortlived sadness though,
as the b-side's "Sea Hag" and the
zippy instrumental "The Itch" got
me up and surfing happily again,
carrying me blindly to the craggy
reef of records that await my ears
for next month. (K Records - P.O.

VANILLA TRAINWRECK
Mordecai
(Mammoth)
Vanilla Trainwreck is an apt
description of this North
Carolina band's sound: a dash
of a sweet and tasty pop
sensibility derailed and dragged
along the tracks. Characterized
by interesting lead guitar bits
and weird slidey/screechy
chords, Mordecai captures the
sound that one has come to
expect from this part of
America while still being fairly
s own right. Plus it
is such oh-so-poetic
lyrics as, "Got a mouth full of
dirt and my shoulders hurt, but I
can recite the alphabet."
Several bands come to mind
while listening to this album,
notably the Tree People on
"Collide-o-scope" and "Kiss
Me" and the ever twisted Honor
Role on "Quagmire" and
"Drownt." Generally, a pretty
catchy, dynamic and consistent

THE QUEERS
Beat Off
(Lookout! Records)
Here it is folks, one of those
kinds of albums, the kind that
hits the turntable on the first
listen and inhabits that circular
spinning pad for a queen's age.
Or in this case, a Queer's age.
Beat Off is one those damn fun
punk rock and roll records that
come out every so often to
knock every other song off of
your personal hits chart and
send every indie slacker kid
with a guitar running for
lessons.
Sandwiched neatly between
the Ramones and Screeching
Weasel like a sweating piece of
cheese, the Queers possess the
astute musical ability to slam
out songs brimming with
hatred, bitterness and contempt
while still being melodic
enough to make Brian Wilson
envious. It's this kind of rock V
roll melody that sent chart-
toppers like Buddy Holly, Iggy
Pop and Blondie to fame and
fortune, and that's where the
Queers would be if this was a
fair world. Punk groups like
Green Day are huge, yet
awesome hit-spitters (and
former Green Day label-mates)
like the Queers remain in the
M

underground shadows. Maybe
Beat Off will send the Queers to
the top. I doubt it, but listening
to a fantastic pop song like
"Mirage" gives a guy hope.

DEEE-LITE
Dewdrops In The Garden
(Elektra)
Dewdrops In The Garden is
Deee-Lite's ihird full length
album of groovy, electronic
dance music. This album
compares in many ways to their
first two releases: they still mix
a variety of sounds into each
song in such a way that they all
blend well with each other, they
have up-beat rhythms, and they
still have the great vocals of
Miss Lady Kier. One difference
with this album is that there
seems to be more spoken lyrics
rather than melodies.
The album starts off with
"Say Ahhh...", a song about
women being sexually liberated.
Deee-Lite has always had the
knack for talking about such
themes in a fun way, so nobody
really gets offended. This track,
along with "Picnic In The
Summertime" and "Apple Juice
Kissing," are some of the better
songs on Dewdrops In The
Garden. Don't get me wrong
though, there are other good
songs on the album; these ones
just strike me as the best. If you
liked Deee-Lite's last albums or
enjoy up-beat dance music then
you will enjoy this album
immensely.
One final note: it appears
that Deee-Lite may have a new
member by looking at their
album cover, but little, if any,
mention is made of it on the
sleeve.      sshhhh
BIF NAKED
4 Songs and a Poem
(Plum Records/A&M)
Having witnessed Gorilla
Gorilla, Chrome Dog and Dying
To Be Violent live, I knew that it
was only a matter of time before
Bif Naked would move closer to
the potential that her voice and
more than adequate stage
persona afforded her. I first
realized how incredibly well she
could sing and strut during her
duet of some Meat Loaf number
with Mr. Pig and his now
defunct but cooler-than-SNFU
outfit Little Joe. Since then I've
made a mental note to check her
here she is with
4 Songs and a
Poem, a prelude
to her forthcoming full-
length release
on Plum
Records. I
suppose Ms.
Naked probably
offends yur
typical feminist
with her cliched
Aerosmith
demeanor, but
hopefully her
true personality
will continue to
manifest itself more and more
once the corporate schmoozing
and rock star stage moves are no
longer necessary.
If this EP bears any relation
to things to come, then diversity
will rule. "Make Like a Tree"
pumps out that chunky
Helmetesque guitar sound oh so
nicely and although I could have
used a notch higher on the vocal
mix for this one, the first play
had the song singing in my ear
for a day or two.
Probably the most defined
melodic structure appears on
"Never Alone (for Jennifa)."
Producer/Writer John Dexter has
done a fine job of making a good
song great with the combination
of acoustic verses and heavy
low-end distorted guitar in the
choruses to bring them home.
Hopefully Jennifa gets moving
and progresses towards her goals
as the song suggests her to do.
"Succulent (for Tridon)" is a
rappy number complete with
drum machines and your typical
turntable noises. I must say that
oral sex seem to be a hot topic
with Bif.
)ue to its lack of freaked out
ibulary and the fact that I
n to be hung on poetry that
the obviously insane, I
almost dismissed "My Satan
Poem" as fluff. But after I reread the words a few times I
realized that Bif is either
schizophrenic, like half the poets
I know, or she is trying to test us
pretentious college radio
fucks...I fail.
I've saved "Tell On You
(A.K.A. Letter To My Rapist)"
for last 'cause I think it is the
best song on the CD. It's almost
hard to believe that this is Bif
singing against the piano
background - this is the most
stripped down and honest I've
ever heard her. (Except maybe
that song she did with Dying to
be Violent about yearning for a
miracle person to fix up her
life.) Describing someone who is
too afraid to report on her
assailant, the song contains the
warning "I know who you are/
Someday I'll have the strength
to tell." After songs like "Luka"
and "Janie's Got a Gun" some
people may feel that abuse songs
are a little tired - well sorry,
you're wrong. Speaking from
personal experience as the
brother of an abuse survivor
(and a survivor of all the guilt
and bullshit that goes with that),
all I can say is that Bif, I can
relate. Thanks.

break before recording Split and
it seems to have paid off in terms
of sounding different from its
predecessors. Some of the songs
are too long, but for the most part,
Split is pleasantly pleasing.
'•**•'•-.
LUSH
Split
(4AD)
Split is the third album from Lush
and, true to their already established sound, they use dreamy effects and soothing female vocals
that would be nice to listen to
whilst smelling black-eyed susans
in some far-off field.
Lead singer Mild still retains
her thick British accent as she
sings songs about love, anger, infidelity and, of course, the dullness of English life. The vocals on
Split are even crisper than those
on Lush's two previous albums
(Gala and Spooky) and have even
evolved to new heights of wispi-
The guitars on the album are
somewhat more raw than on
Spooky, probably because Lush
were under a great deal of pressure with this release due to their
association with the once loved
but now ridiculed shoe-gazing
scene. The band took a two year
less, a Beatles/Byrds/Rolling
Stones influence is clearly
present both in songwriting, and
arrangement. •
At 45 minutes in length,
Sloan has prepared a release full
of oh-so-sugary pop songs, such
as the first single "Coax Me," or
SLOAN
Twice Removed
(GefTen/MCA)
Ever hear of SloanNet? It's an
east coast based music mailing
list which, funnily enough,
sometimes features discussion of
Sloan! I've
SloanNet for
five months
myself, and
only in the last
month or so
has the topic
of Sloan's new
up. Some
friends of the
band, along
with some
other Halifax
suggested
amongst other
things that:
1) Twice Removed was the
album that would get Sloan
dumped from Geffen.
2) This album was entirely retro/
classic rock sounding.
Not particularly positive
feedback I'd say, but, having
now heard the album myself I'd
like to say that:
1) Twice Removed isn't likely to
get Sloan dumped from Geffen.
(In fact it should have enough
appeal to sell better than their
first full length CD, Smeared)
2) The songs axe about as retro
or classic rock sounding as
anything by the Posies or
Matthew Sweet, or any of the
millions of the Bealtesque tunes
that have permeated the
airwaves over the last 25 years. I
don't consider that to be classic
rock. Besides, there was a hint
of this direction in a few of the
songs on Smeared, so I don't
entirely understand how some
people were so surprised by the
sound of this record. Nonethe-
the first track, "Pen Pals." These
are the kinds of tunes that won't
leave your head for days, and
even then, you might wish them
to go on. Twice Removed also
has more substance than its
predecessor, making for an m
overall better listening experi-

CRUNT
Crunt
(Trance Records) .
Crunt is real gritty and real
shitty. I don't use shitty as a
nasty adjective here at all though
- just the opposite in fact. It's
Crunt's essential shiftiness that
gives this recording its appeal.
Loose (think Stooges) and raw
(early Mudhoney), Crunt scores    §
on almost every tune. The
centerpeice of the album is the
disturbing Kat Bjelland vocal
track, "Unglued"- her singing
never fails to send shivers
through me. The distinct S&M
flavour of "Punishment," with a
chorus of "This is gonna hurt       ™
you more than it's gonna hurt
me but I wouldn't have it any
other way," is hilarious in its
own twisted way. With the
combined talents of members of
Babes in Toyland, the Jon
Spencer Blues Explosion and        g
Lubricated Goat, Crunt pulls off
an energetic and entertaining

SEX WITH NIXON
Starfish Room
Friday, August 12
Let's make one thing
perfectly clear: the Starfish
Room needs air-conditioning and cheaper beer.
Although it could be said
that the expensive beer will
pay for the air-conditioning,
surely there must be a
happy medium between
$4.50 a bottle and 120
degrees heat! You know it's
hot when the three Texans
who make up Reverend
Horton Heat are complaining, for at the Starfish it
was as if the good Reverend
had been pitted against the
fiery flames of hell itself.
But battle he did, and for an
hour and a half the Reverend Horton Heat and 400
wet Vancouverites bopped
until the beer ran dry. Beer
or no beer, the show still
rolled on until certain
audience members actually
started licking the walls for
fear of utter dehydration.
With the amount of smoke
that clogged the Starfish
that night, it truly looked as
if the room was smouldering
- further proof that those of
us who attend rock and roll
gigs are damned for it.
Local openers Sex With
Nixon were the match that
lit the blaze, starting off the
night with at intense stage
show that would rival most
in these parts. All in all, a
very cool show.

THE SMUGGLERS
BUM
PLUTO
Commodore Ballroom
Saturday, August 6
A few Saturdays ago there
was a grand, smashing show
at the lovely Commodore
featuring Pluto, Bum, The
Smugglers and cub. First up
was Pluto, but unfortunately
I rolled in late and only
caught their last song.
Next on stage were those
fellows from Bum, playing
a set that brings to mind
words like loud, fast,
precise and fun. And it must
be mentioned that the lead
singer of Bum has great
pants and tremendous hair.
Following Bum was The
Smugglers, but as I am
related to their singer I
won't say much about them.
It did seem like the crowd
were enjoying the Smugglers music and jokes
though. Another thing I
noticed is that people are
actually dancing these days
- really shakin' and jumpin'
and not just banging into
each other. It makes a show
even more fun.
The final band to play
was cub, appearing on stage
with their ever-loved loot
bags stuffed full with
balloons, lollipops, stickers
and lots of other treats. The
band played some old
songs, as well as some new
ones that sound quite a bit
different but even better
than their older stuff, cub's
popularity shot up really
fast but seems to be levelling out now with fans who
truly understand the
intricate knowledge buried
beneath the simple surface.
All in all, a more than
satisfying show.
Heather Lawrence
FOLKFEST '94
Jericho Beach
I go to Folkfest to see
inspiring moments, moments when the performers
are not just playing another
gig and I am not just seeing
one. Sometimes these
moments are created by a
sixty year old musician
who's been playing similar
songs for forty years and is
still really singing them, or
perhaps by a middle-aged
union songwriter who only
started plying music a year
before. Every year there are
times like that, and this
year's Festival was no
exception.
Ani DeFranco was the
'star' of the festival this
year, but, thankfully, she
didn't take this designation
too seriously. Not that she
doesn't deserve it, but it
would have been rather
irritating. The nervousness
DeFranco showed at '92's
Folkfest was gone, and
along with drummer Andy
Stochansky, she played a
cookin' set which she
opened with the words,
"Too fucking weird." At ten
a.m. in the midst of a
gr°ggy bunch of folkies,
that's a moment.
Saturday night's
mainstage feature was Vede
Hille and her band. Vede
Hille mentions the
Rheostatics in a song and
her music does have a
similar eclectic pop feel as
well as a similar amount of
soul. Her set was loud and
dynamic, so I just layed
back and enjoyed the
I'm not very fond of
the cliche's of folk
songwriting: witty, warm,
melodic, inoffensive songs
which blend together into
that conformity that makes
90% of any genre's music
irrelevant. Most folkfest
songwriters are like this,
but not Mo Field. Mo
surprised me on Sunday
morning with great
acoustic playing and a
dark jazz tune. She didn't
say 'fuck' but she did \
make fun of a fellow
performer, which is also
not normal at Folkfest. Mo
and Vede are both locals,
so go see them!
Claudia Schmidt isn't
local, but if I can see her
again I'll be there. She
plays twelve string blues
folk and writes great
songs, but her voice is just
unstoppable: she had the
best voice I have ever
heard at the festival.
For the first time ever I
avoided sunstroke all
weekend, but I did get
rained on early Sunday
night and, since I'd
already had enough
moments, I left before I
got a chance to applaud
the festival staff. So
thanks for another great
festival - til next year.

Now, with the sun setting on another Vancouver summer,
we look towards the autumn harvest of new
import and domestic releases...
Stereolab
<§   Mars Audtac Quintet
Transforming these formula-secure times,
Stereolab's charms lie in their simple melodies and syncopated moog/guitar rhythms.
Yes, reigning paradigms of compulsive and
beautiful songs in the words of Parisian
Laetitia Sadier, "I think art should be cathartic
and point to your deepest anxieties," so come
on indie rocker, come on.
O 16.98 PS  10.98
Sebadoh
®   Bakesale
Simplified, but never simple, Sebadoh's
latest and mostly Eric-less release has a concise pop rock consistency. As prolific as they
are self-aware, Sebadoh's Bakesale adds to an
already voluminous discography, and never
fails to entertain.
O 14.98 m 9.98
Lync
@   These Are Not Fall Colours
Of the Olympia, Washington school of angst-
driven indie rock, Lync take inspiration from
contemporaries such as Unwound, but combine pop with driving energy to produce a
broad and enjoyable release.
O 14.98 ai^^^ -: ...
Pavement
#   Gold Soundz
Gold records is more like iti Who would
have thought that such slackers would
aspire to indie rock greatness, and Rolling
Stone poster boy success? Another fine EP
proving their worth. Pavement is payment.
O EP 7.98
Guided by Voices
<§   The Grand Hour
Guided by greatness is more like it! Who'd
have thought that indie rock's newest
songwriting genius would be a Dayton,
Ohio gradeschool teacher? Six fine new
tunes to hold you until Scat reissues their
huge back catalogue.
© EP 8.98
The Flaming Lips
®   Providing Needles For
Your Balloons
Flaming Hits is more like it! Who'd have
though that these Oklahoma hicks would still
be releasing such amazing songs of psychedelic noise-pop after more than a decade? This
45 minute EP also includes a Smog cover and
a much-loved Christmas carol.
O 12.98
Luscious Jackson
•   Natural Ingredients
Man, this Luscious Jackson band has
definitely got it goin' on! They're smoking
so righteously at Lollapalooza, and this new
spin is sure to funk you right up. So baby, be
hip to what's happening and grab this, NOW!
O 16.98 m  10.98
Orbital
®   Snivelization
This follow up release to the critic's faves
OrbiM and Orbital 2, Snivelization provides
these UK ambient/techno wizards with a hat
trick of great releases. Truly an influential
band at the crest of their craft.
O 16.98 m 10.98
Julian Cope
®   Autogeddon
Simmering gently at times, rocking at others,
this record sees JC continue to lose more
bricks off the top of his load. Autogeddon is
yet another innovative and varied collection
of songs from the brilliant, twisted mind of
Saint Julian. All hail the patron saint of
messed up, self-involved, flaky, artsy-types.
Welcome this gem into your collection today.
© 16.98 m 10.98
Sugar
®   Your Favorite Thing
Enticing guitar hooks. A puppy dog's growl.
Three unreleased tracks. Ginger Ale bubbles
tickling your nose. A familiar voice. A grape
Slurpee". A low price. These are a few of our
favorite things — soon to be yours!
O EP 7.98
Afghan Whigs
•   What Jail Is Like
Unfortunately, some of the best Afghan
Whigs songs have been appendages to singles or released as promotional items only.
This EP solves all of that! This, the second
single from last autumn's Gentlemen release,
includes covers of the Ass Ponys' Mr Super-
love and Percy Sledge's Dark End Of The
Street, as well as a track exclusive to the
Volume series (Little Girl Blue) and three live
tracks, including a Supremes duo of My
World Is Empty Without You Babe and 1 Hear
A Symphony. Subliminal!}- erotic, titillating,
sorrowful, and menacing.
O EP 12.98
All special prices

TicketMaster outlet,
