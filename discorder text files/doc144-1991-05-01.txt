Almost all of thealbums mentioned
in DISCORDER arefromall-male bands.
Most of the writing is by men and about
men. Females are rarely mentioned, and if
they are it's usually a put-down to build
up the ego of the writer.
And why do the CITR airplay lists
include such a low percentage of bands
with one or more female members? The
inequality of the CITR lists (albums and
Airhead,
I am continually amazed and appalled at
the cynical approach DISCORDER often

All of us at Point Grey's finest radio station are pleased to present Discorder. Caution though! Discorder is not meant to be taken on its own.
Chances are, that if this mag is read in its entirety by a non-listener, terrible things might happen; bewilderment, nausea, or even death. For
this reason we advise that Discorder be cut with 100% pure CITR. One part Discorder to nine parts CITR. Simple. Remember though, don't
get carried away with Discorder. Its purpose is not to curb your aural fixation, but to enhance it.
So what is Discorder? Why does a radio station put out a program guide? Essentially, to improve communication, and isn't that what
radio is all about? By improving communication everyone benefits. Publishing this guide means that you'll be able to read about the music
that CITR playlists and to find out when CITR broadcasts its various features. At the same time Discorder gives us (the people behind the
dials) a chance to hear from you. Something on your mind? Write to the Airhead. He wants to hear from you. Hopefully Discorder will reflect
not only what happens at Vancouver's alternative music station, but what happens in the city itself so far as music, entertainment, and
innovation are concerned.
Now that you know what Discorder is, I'll tell you a few things about CITR. CITR is UBC's student radio station which broadcasts from
the Point Grey campus. Because the station is licensed as a low power operation, some parts of the city get better reception than others. If you
can't get us at precisely 101.9 FM, even with an antenna, you're in a sound warp and will have to plug into your cablevision outlet and tune
to 100.1 FM. (Call CITR or the cable company for details).
CITR is a non-profit, non-commercial station. Money comes from two sources: directly from students' pockets via Alma Mater Society
Tees, and from off-air activities undertaken by the station. These things include playing music in UBC's Pit and hiring out our mobile sound
service. The station is run by about 100 volunteers (with one full-time, paid employee) who are mostly UBC students. Membership is open
to everyone: students and non-students. Your support and help is always needed, so ifyou are interested, why not drop by?
Being a non-commercial station CITR is free to explore the vast realm of today's music which is located just beyond the sight (or should:;
I s*y "sonnd") of most other music stations. Our Playlist is not generated by a computer from somewhere "back east" or "down south." We
are not afraid of playing music or airing spoken word material that transcends what commercial programmers view as the "proper norm."
CITR has been an alternative music station since the mid-seventies and we know that there are no "proper norms" for music or anything else.
We also know that a large segment ofthe city's population is sick of listening to the same old tried-and-true sounds of commercial radio. You
know that an alternative exists. As one longtime CITR deejay recently remarked "We have no target market, we have nothing to sell.
market is anyone who wants to listen." Nuff said.
If all goes well, Discorder will be your monthly guide to CFTR. It will continue to be free and will be available at some of Vancouver
test locations. Wasn't the place you got this one nice? Till March 1st then, keep listening. CITR is designed to satisfy you aurally.

Discorder _ "The Scene:' where has the last nine years
taken us? In por ing over the last 99 issues of Discorder, our
s_ffexperienc£d(suffered?)acollectivewaveof nostalgia
for the 'alternative scene' that &% Tom Anselmi once
called nonexistent: "Fuck the scene.", Anselmi eulogized,
"It has finally died in the arms of morons and Hoodsuck-
ers." And to think that that was in 1988. Like the shower of
warm, flat beer spilled from the coffee table that one feels
when one awakens the morning after a great party, only to
find one had passed out nude on the living room floor for
all to see, this quote caused us to sputter, shake our heads,
andmost importantly, OPEN OUREYES. He wasright. A
meeting was held, and by a very narrow margin, the
Discorder publications committee decided it was time for
a serious format change. Some ofthe factors that played a
significant role in our decision were:
• Coast AM 800 - This ingenious little upstart truly has its
finger on the pulse of Vancouver's underground music community. As much as we hate to admit it, inless
than one year, The Spirit of Radio has us licked. Not
only are they a far better vehicle for the city's advertisers, but face it: with their combo of local radio icons
like Shadow Stevens and the cream of ex-CiTR's DJ's
like Paula Spun, their programming can't be beat.
• Nite Moves/AFMtgizine - With articles on Vancouver's
tastiest underground stars (Tankhog, Dogzilla, Bob's
Yer Uncle, The Odds... the list is endless), as well as
all the big name touring acts (Sonic Youth, Jellyfish,
Hitmen... etc), these two tabloid-style (no, we weren't
thefirst)paperseffectivelycoverallthebases,leaving
us only to lap up the scraps. Both have far higher
production values (witness NMs full colour cover,
AFs anarchic yet readable layouts, and the fact that
both are stapled and trimmed), and, as one of our
longtime friends commented, "[They're] a much bet-
• UTV - Say what you want, but this indie TV station has
com; a long way from the infamous Emannuelkdays.
Take Discorder and give ir a soundtrack and you've
got the brilliantly minimal UTonight, hosted by CiTR
alumnus Chris Hebb. Fuck Dave Letterman, this guy
is wicked with his acerbic 'I don't give a shit' attitude.
And besides, who else would have the gusto to show
a No Fun performance openly taunting prudish viewers by yelling "Shitless" at the end? 'Nuff said.
• The Georgia Straight - OK, we've had our moments
poking fun at 'The Vancouver Weekly' , but in all
honesty, it lives up to its name admirably. Probably
evenStraighlemployees wouldagree there have been
a few fairly superficial stories scattered over the last
few years, but with the Straight's recent commitment
to cover issues as well as entertainment, they've (to
their credit, mind you) effectively gobbled up the last
area of interest to our once-loyal readership.
The point is this. Sure, back in 1983 CiTR and Discorder
may have meant something to someone, but what with
Bush Mulroney, the new conservativism, and the intense
competition from other Vancouver media (above), we've
found ourselves torn between staying on the 'cutting
edge', dealing with extremely obscure bands and issues in
the hopes that we can reachthe five people who are actually
interested (and who, together, probably couldn't scrape up
enough change for a cigarette, let alone one of our advertisers' products), andpresentingmore accessible, but sadly
more bland and ultimately disposable coverage of a tired
scene that is propped up, it seems, only by our desire to
perpetuate it. After all, how many inane Nardwar articles
or long-winded interviews with eastern European bands
with unpronounceable names can Vancouver take? The
sheer volume of critical letters we receive daily would
suggest that we surpassed the saturation point long ago.
Something better change, as D.O.A. once wrote, and that
something is us. Unable to decide on an appropriate
direction for the new Discorder (if, indeed, it will be called
that), we enlisted the services of Kagetsu Associates, a
local PR film, to help us tailor our new approach They
suggested we go around the campus, the city and the
province to find out what people wanted to see, so here,
then, is our readers' survey for 1991. Please fill it out and
send it back to us. They say that in this day and age the only
way to cast a vote is at the cash register, but the mailbox is
rhe next best bet. Remember you can't bitch if you don't
IThe following survey is based on the Rosenberg-Flexo survey model provided by the MIT Publicity Research studies of Rosenberg and Smith (1967). The most unique   |
feature of the survey is that the questions, owing to their 'open-ended' structure, offer a flexible mode of response. Please feel free to use a second sheet of paper
if you would prefer to give long-hand responses. Please complete the survey in black ink and mail it to: Discorder Survey, #233 - 6138 SUB Blvd., Vancouver, BC
CANADA V6T1 Zl. While the inclusion of your name and telephone number would be appreciated, it is by no means obligatory. Please be advised that by returning
this survey, you are consenting to having your answers used, in whole or in part, in whatever way either Discorder or Kagetsu Associates sees fit.

10   THE 100TH DISCORDER g Have you ever noticed that whatever you do downtown, be it
1 i I I ^* I ^^ Y^fc wyn XT"   waiting for a bus in the rain at rush hour, leisurely strolling down
■Wl |_J |3| ^^ O X If I J _!^ IX   ^ ^ree. ^ a sunny afternoon, or being helped out of a bar at
^    B^1^^' ^^ closing time, music—or some reasonable facsimile—accompanies
your activities? And have you ever wondered who the musicians are who play this soundtrack of your life and why they
don't have lives of their own? Many's the time you've hurried past buskers, feigning oblivion to their open guitar cases,
wondering these very things. Not one to wallow in ignorance, Mindy Abramowitz hit the streets to get some answers.
1 flC first and foremost thing I learned was that buskers certainly
do not see themselves as purveyors of incidental mood music for
other peoples' lives. In fact, most of them take what they do quite
seriously. The buskers I spoke to all had very specific reasons for
doing what they do. Some play to make a living, some do it to help
their Welfare cheques go a little further, while others only want a
place to play and be heard. One young man informed me that he and
his busking companions were not a band, but they had nowhere else
to jam.
Whatever their reason for busking, however, most musicians
invoke the mighty muse Freedom to explain the appeal of the streets.
Alexander Krahe told me that he chose to play on Granville Street
because there he can earn a living doing what he loves best. As a
blues musician, he finds Vancouver lacking in venues. Rather than
wait literally years to get a booking at the Yale, he decided to take
to the street, beside the Roxy, to be exact. There, he can play the
music he wants to play.
Down the street from Alexander, in front of the Orpheum, Tim
Butler plays "political war songs" between swigs of Jack Daniels.
He busks because it gives him a chance to work on his vocals away
from the demands and hypocrisy of the music business. He is
currently recording a folk album with Bill Clint, but his principle
occupation appears to be busking, which is what he has been doing
on a part-time basis in Vancouver for a year. Tim and Alexander
used to play in a band together, but they gave it up for busking
separately.
Bands like the Rattled Roosters and Sister Lovers, who put in
regular appearances downtown as well as at Granville Island, enjoy
the immediate gratification of audience participation. The dynamics
ofthe street-style stadium," as a member of Sister Lovers terms it,
favour a more interactive, energetic brand of musical performance
than can be successfully presented from a stage in a bar. Sister Lovers
like to engage their audiences in such games as Stump the Busker,
where spectators name obscure songs in hopes of catching the
performers out on ones they don't know. The Rattled Roosters leap
on and off trees and benches—in addition to their own instruments—
in their acrobatic outdoor shows. On the streets, these bands feel free
to experiment with the space and the relationship between themselves and their audiences in ways that would most likely fail in a
more formal environment.
If you're asking yourself why more musicians don't busk if it's
so free and accessible, allow me to shed some light on the downside
of this phenomenon. Of course, one must be prepared to endure rain,
snow, sub-zero temperatures and any other climatic inconveniences
Vancouver is prone to, but worse than that, a busker also needs to be
hardy enough to weather physical danger and the inevitable "Stairway to Heaven" requests. Stock hassles that face buskers include
penny-peltings from dissatisfied spectators, puking patrons, and, in
some cases, police intervention. Buskers who choose to perform at
Granville Island and in Skytrain and Seabus stations encounter a
variety of problems and restrictions.
At Granville Island, musicians must observe the 30-minute
time limit at each busking location. Thus, in order to continue
playing, they must either pack up and move to another spot at the end
of each set, or else wait in line for another turn at the same place. At
the end of every thirty minute stint, performers lose their patrons and
have to start fresh.
B.C. Transit's approach to busking precludes any notion of
democracy. Buskers must first audition for a licence to play and,
once chosen, must follow a timetable and play only when and where
scheduled. Groups are restricted to a maximum of two people and,
according to regulations, they may use litde or no amplification lest
they drown out the emergency speakers in the stations. While,
according to B.C. Transit's spokesperson in Corporate Communications, musicians citywide covet their exclusive busking licences,
they grant only a scant 12 to 15 per year.
Even downtown, most of the prime busking locations have
been claimed. Tim Butler, who many acknowledge as occupying the
best spot on Granville Street, claims that his place was left to him by
its previous occupant, a sax player who quit busking to drive a cab.
Naturally, newcomers jockey for turf, but Tim and others assured me
that all buskers observe a tacit code of ethics based on mutual
respect. You don't crowd other buskers and you don't steal their
audiences. A very mild but nonetheless compelling senseof community guides them.
While busking lacks the blatant defiance and debatable glamour of say, Subpop, or some other emblem of subversion, in its own
unobtrusive way it represents, for a rugged few, a more palatable
alternative to the music industry. One busker even admitted to not
knowing any Led Zeppelin except for a few bars of "Stairway to
Heaven"—the rest he fakes.

The only cool way to dr
floor of a closet swimming in
your own body juices, contemplating suicide. At least that's
more interesting than sitting
on an ass-bending velvet
stool, staring at the ceiling and
being rubbed on by a skinny
ties like glasses, paper umbrellas, olives on swords, celery and salt on the rim; instead,
huff some glue in a parking lot,
slam down some cheap wine,
yell at old ladies and puke on
the slurpee machine at 7-11.
Unfortunately, however, most
people like paying big coin to
sit in a hell of a smokey noisy
crowded room, and we at Discorder realize this. So, just for

THE EDGE
The Edge is an afterhours club
(11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Fridays and
Saturdays. Recently they have
been videotaping punk concerts
early Friday evenings.) The clientele is mainly new wave fash-
ion-people-who-dress in black-
Besides the usual soft drinks, the
snack bar sells Winstons (yea)
and poppers (boo). Poppers are
little legal bottles of a liquid a lot
like paint thinner. Poppers are
the moral equivalent of sniffing
glue. The people who frequent
The Edge think they are decadent. The washrooms at the Edge
are open to either sex... Themusic
is mostly electronic disco with a
hard edge. No pun intended...
HEAVEN
Heaven is also an after hours
club, open 9 pm to 5 am Friday
and Saturdays... The dancefloor
features a smoke machine, four
racks of lights, eight neon lightning bolts and a UFO, a very
rotatable circular ring of lights...
The music is progressive/disco/
top 40... After 4 am the beat and
the volume drop and people begin leaving like they just remembered that they left the tub running...
SHAKERS
Shakers is filled with a 12 to 18
crowd that all dream of their
19th birthday, so they can all go
to Richards on Richards... Most
of the boys are preppies or new
romantics in white sweaters.
Many of the girls wear dresses,
heels and coiffered hair... The
dance floor is usually fully occupied... Going into Shakers is
like entering a parallel universe
which never had a Joey Ramone.
(Dave Watson, 1985)
THE SAVOY
The Savoy nightclub is housed
in one ofthe few remaining structures erected before the city of
Vancouver was
one year old. In
1886 John
Boultbee's law
office was located at the
southeast corner of Carrall
and Powell
Streets, which
today looks out
over the cobblestone street
which passes
through Maple
Tree Square.
Mr. Boultbee
was the first
magistrate of
the City of Vancouver and was
appointed at the
first meeting of
City Council on
the tenth day of
May, 1886...
Although the history of the
Savoy is rather difficult to trace
(owing to changing street names
and addresses), it is certain that
the neighbourhood was certainly a thriving and active area...
Finally in 1973, the Savoy Cabaret arose, showcasing rock and
jazz music.
Happily, this fine old building at 6 Powell is still kept out of
its life and it very nearly was
demolished, along with the spirit of Rose Campbell. The Smi-
lin' Buddha faces the same danger as so many ofthe other wonderful venues and theatres which
once dotted Vancouver's downtown area near Hastings and
Main... The Railway Club and
the Commodore Ballroom are
also on the City Council's insidious "hit list." This means that
tentative development permit applications have been filed with
the City Council on both these
buildings, which will subsequently reduce the lot and make
way for the increasingly popular
Bauhausian skyscraper. It is up
to the City Planning Department
to save these and other buildings
(such as the Tudor Manor on
Pacific Avenue) which ought to
be designated heritage sites.
Ironically, 1986 is Vancouver's 100th birthday, and yet, so
many of Vancouver's finest examples of architecture arequick-
ly becoming demolished to make
way for the anniversary. The
Orillia, once the famed Tamale
Parlour and home to Vancouver's first gay club, met a sad
demise last April when a Hong
Kong financier ordered the place
razed. Our favourite nightspots
must be preserved, if not for
their architecturalvirtues, at least
for their sociological values. The
next time you walk into your
fave club to see your fave band,
whether that place might be the
Commodore, The Railway Club,
The New York Theatre, The
Savoy or the Smilin' Buddha,
think of all the different people
that have passed through their
danger, having been designated doorsoverthelastcentury.Think
a heritage site. However, John about how much history is
Boultbee's office is the only one packed between the walls and
which is protected from bull- consider what Vancouver enter-
dozers. In 1979 the Friends of tainment once represented...
the York Theatre had to fight for (Elspeth Robinson, 1985)

132 POWELL STREET   688-1 752 (PHONE OR FAX) & 669-01 27 BUTTHOLE
SURFERS:
THAT WAS THEN,
by Angie Finley, Travis Bickle, Jay Scott and Noddy
"It was just a wild show, but it didn't really get wild until the
show was over. You have a band with three sort of hippies and
three bright but psychotic people—the three front people.
Gibby, Paul and Pinkus. And after the show, Gibby had cut his
arm and we'd taken him to the hospital. Meanwhile, Paul, the
guitar player, was really mad at Pinkus, the bass player, for
some reason or other. We had to restrain him, actually pin him
to the ground on four separate occasions, just to calm him
down. He threw a bottle of beer at us. We had to duck and it
smashed against the wall behind our heads. He smashed every
glass in the place. At one point, he sprayed. Pinkus with lighter
fluid and tried to set him on fire. That was a little harsh. You
don't usually run into that sort of attitude."
So you say to yourself, the Butthole Surfers, big fucking deal,
just what are they? Rumours
always precede historical
events, that's a fact, and the
rumours say that the B u tt holes
are living in a van with a dog,
accountant types on acid, militant homosexuals, devil worshippers in white tube socks.
None of this is true. This band
is CLEAN, upstanding and
responsible. These people are
from the heartland ofthe USA
and they grew up on TV and
evangelism, corn flakes and a
morality that reflects all that
is right and good in America.
DiSCORDER: Hi, how's it going?
JEFF PINKUS: All right. You
caught me right after a bong hit;
I was just having a coffee break.
I didn't realize I h^d another
interview. Lucky I didn't leave.
Where are you out of?
Vancouver, B.C.
Oh, OK, I think we're coming
there. Actually, I think it's the
only place in Canada we are going to...
What kind of special plans do
you have for this tour?
A couple of elephants and two
black guys with, like, these cowboy hats. Not really anything I
should tell you about. You
wouldn't want to write about it
because then if we got there and
everyone knows, it's always a
drag when we get to town and
everyone's talking about the fire
cymbal and all that.
"Well, it was sort of like 1NNA-
GADDA-DA-VIDA, only longer, stranger, and more dangerous, with more feedback and
brighter strobe lights, with valuable input from Jacques Coust-
eau, the Ohio State Patrol and
various dead people, with more
brutal human nakedness than a
responsible society needs, and
Gibby kept lighting his hand on
fire, and the audience didn't
know whether they should slam
dance or pray, and a lot of punkers didr. t Ifkeii(neither didTom
Selleck, tiho was there-f^-and
then Gibby lit a cymbal on fire
and cut his hand on ii, and suddenly it was all over sooner than
anyone realized," remembers
Noddy.
Any reason your new album's
called PIOUGHD?
No. It's not really called PIOUGHD. I think Rough Trade
made that up. No, it's actually a
rough one to pronounce; it's like
lblblb click click click click
Iblblbl click. But you see, it was
rough to come up for a spelling
for it. I think there might be a
guy who's an Indian over at
Rough Trade and he saw that
and related it to his language...
We wanted to name something
for a long time and since I named
my dog Lincoln—well, we could
have called the album Lincoln
but I don't think it would have
been as good.
Is there any reason this album
sounds more mainstream than
past efforts?
There's not really much reason
at all, it's just more or less the
way it turned out. That was home
recording and we were playing
with all of our toys... We did that
album about a year and a half
ago and we already had a whole
bunch of other songs that we still
hadn't recorded that will come
out on our. next album wliich
we've already got enough material for. But that stuff, a lot of it,
we just kinda did in the studio
while we were hanging out and
blew off the songs we knew just
'cause they were entertainment
at the time.
Are you aiming for mainstream acceptance?
I think if we do get that with this
album, then people are gonna
hate us when the next album
comes out because the material
is no thin' like that... I don' t think
"No, I'mlron Man" is very commercial, but there are a couple
that definitely I can see getting
it. But we're kind of proud that
people would consider it sounds
good enough to be commercial
even though we recorded it at
home.
Some of your fans are "distressed" thatyou'regoing commercial.
That's great. Commercial people make lots of money, don't
they? I wanna make money and
then you can call me commer-
ciaL And I don't mind a bit...
People said the same-thing about
the commercial thing when Rembrandt Pussyhorsecame out, then
we put out Locust Abortionist
Technician after that and people
were saying they liked that a lot
more and then we put out Hair-
way and then people went back
to the commercial thing again. I
guess this is like two [albums]
people have told us are commercial, that's two in a row, so I
guess people must be getting
worried about the Butthole Surf-
Noisemongering is born and
the Buttholes are the foundation of a new movement in
music that reflects all the traditional ways to sell records.
No haircuts, no fashion, no
image, mysterious enigmas
who exist only in the minds of
hysterical devotees. Small
record pressings, not major
label deals or promo hype here,
just rock and roll noise, distorted vocals and wild guitars
punctuated by the scream or
plea.
Is your music a statement?
I don'tknow. I don'treally write
the lyrics. Gibby writes the lyrics and I write music. Music
doesn't really have a philosophy. Like Gibby says, I might be
thinking about things blowing
up and he's thinking of flowers
and we hear the same melody.
What are you trying to do with
your music?
Well, I wanna buy a ranch and
have a studio and have a $ 10,000
pool table and have at least four
hot rods and three muscle cars
and I'll take one economy car, as
long as it's not, like, a BMW or
something, and that's more or
less what we're trying to do.
Tell me about your band, the
Jack Officers.
The J.O. are still going. That just
came out about a month ago, I
guess, but that's stuff that we
had worked on for about two and
a half years.
Why did you decide to do it?
It was just something we ended
up doing. We kinda got a kick
out of the songs we were coming
up with and we had the equipment and it was just a lot of fun
to do. It wasn't something we
did in a week or two weeks. We
wrote songs and kept throwing
them out with the intentions of
making a J.O. record eventually.
Some people call it House; other
people call it other things... It
just doesn't sound anything like
the BHs. We didn't even want to
mention the BH but it was the
only way Rough Trade could
sell it.
So are you going to tour?
No. Actually, I played my last
show as the J.O. the other week,
but Gibby might take it on the
By himself?
Well, not by himself, but probably with our dancer, Kathleen.
Maybe with Al Jorgensen. Who
knows?
For those brave enough to try,
few will succeed, as the Butt-
holes and the whole noisemon-
gering movement forces you
to think. This is not nice music
that floats over your head... it
hits you right in the glands
when you least expect it. Good
luck, you'll need all you can
get.

by Jerome Broadway
A woman I know once told a friend of mine that I was a "misogynist." My
friend, like any true ally, replied: "He's not a misogynist* he's a misanthrope" With that in mind, here's who I hate in Vancouver.
J.B. SHAYNE AND
JOHN TANNER
Call it unrequited love, but these
guys used to be heroes of mine
when they were on Cable Ten's
NIGHT DRE AMS. It was agreat
video show—before there were
video shows—around '79 to "81.
Now as DJs on Soap 800, they
sound, like they wouldn't be out
of place on QM FM. Maybe it's
the effect of commercial radio
on intelligent minds, but these
guys have definitely lost their
edge.
PAULA SPURR
Formerly CiTR's "Paula the
Radio Sex Goddess," she wasn' t
the best female voice to grace
Ihe mighty R 's airwaves but was
certainly up near the top. Now,
to hear her on Soap 800, she
sounds like someone's about to
askher: "Paula, how's thetraffie
out diere?" To quote a friend,
"She's lost her sex."
KIM CLARK CHAMP-
NESS
Ignoring the fact that Much
Mucous has the largest collection of the least talented people
in the country, this former Van-
couverite is heir to Robin Leach:
knid, obnoxious, and equipped
with an exaggerated phony British accent. If Shayne and Tanner
have lost their edge, Champness
should just get LOST.
THE GRIFFITHS
Owners of the Vancouver
Canucks and Western Broadcasting (whose holdings include
CKNW, CFMI and BCTV),
they are the kin(|«£rich fat cats
that plays used to be written
about in Maoist China. They
have been ripping off the hockey fans in this city for years by
charging exorbitant ticket prices while presenting an inferior
product. What kind of cheapskate operation takes rows of
seats that have always been in
the medium-priced blues, paints
them red and cranks up the ticket
price tai bucks apiece. Will they
ever spend any of this profit on
the free-agent market or on
scouting? No! Should they be
tried before a People's Tribunal? Yes!
BERNIE PASCALL
Toupeed Head of the Sports
Department at BCTV. I defy
anyone to find a blander human
being on the face of the earth.
Why Bernie isn't covering gardening instead of sports is something for Unsolved Mysteries.
TOM LARSCHIED
Colour commentator for 'NW
and BCTV Canucks' games,
Tom combines ihe two worst
possible aspects of sports broad-
casting: he talks too much and
knows nothing about the topic.
Every time he opens his mouth,
hackneyed mispronunciations
pour out Of course, knowing
absolutely nothing about hockey hasn't stopped the King of
Cliches from being an apologist
for every mediocre player and
inane move the Canuckleheads
make.
TERRY DAVID MULLIGAN
Need I say more?
STU JEFFRIES
T.D. Mulligan Jr. Nothing good
or rockin' about this guy. My
choice for person I'd most like
to see become a Nancy-Re-
agan's-worst-nightm are-drug
addict. But would heroin turn
off that piano key smile?
MR, SMITH
A weird former landlord who"
gave me an eviction notice five
days into my tenancy. Afterwards, he insisted I wasn't even
a tenant, just a visitor. And of
landtords,Smith played the old
stiff- 'em-on-the-damage-depos-

PETER TOIGO
Owner of the White Spot restaurants and a bidder on the
Expo land site. Toigo's to be
hated not for being a buddy of
deposed Premier FantasyZalm,
but for raining a good restaurant of my childhood. When the
employees went on strike for
fairer p ay, Mr. Toigo bu lldozed
the struck restaurants and sold
the property. The giant White
Spot at 68th and Granville,
which mysteriously burnt to the
ground, has been replaced by a
plastic mall. Thanks for destroying the memories, Peter.
DENNY BOYD
Vancouver Sun columnist.
There is nothing worse than a
""Self-righteous reformed boozer. I thought it was funny when
tired old Denny wrote columns
about what low-lifes people
were who drank, and then
promptly went out and got himself an impaired charge. When
he isn't preaching, he's writing
nostalgic pap. His impassioned
pleas in his columns for Eleni
and Nelson Skalbania to get
back together were an all-time
low point in Vancouver jour
nalism. An average UBC English major would be a vast
improvement.
JIM SANDLAK
Vancouver Canucks forward.
Sandbag, as some people call
him, is big, strong, and useless.
Thi s former fir s t round draft pick
makes more per year than you
do in ten, but plays about as hard
as you do with your cat. If professional sports is a cruel business, all the more reason to give
Sandbag the axe.

TWO LADIES FROM
TELEFILM CANADA
These two ladies, who are responsible for deciding what local films get Telefilm funding,
told associates of mine mat their

script was about neither house

hell does this mean? I suggest
dates with Tom Larscheid for
both of them.

SANDY COX
This gentleman is the developer

typical of the insensitive and
greedy developers that infest this
city, is to turn the Stanley in to a
retail complex for the elite,
Didn' t the mas ses used to rise up
against the landholders? Not a
bad idea, is it?
UTV
Formerly* CKVU TV, this station has gone from entertaining—it used to show soft pom
late at night—to shamelessly
pandering to airhead yuppies.
Every time I hear their UTV
slogan, I say FUTV.
MAYOR GORDON
CAMPBELL
A former manager of giant Marathon Realty, I sure hope his
developer buddies aregivinghim

there's absolutely no excuse for
"his city" to have so many victims of the wreckers' ball. I bet
he likes UTV.
THE NPA, COPE, AND

Success in politics should not be
dictated by party affiliation. If

each of the aforementioned for
making city politics a members-

BDH EXECUTIVE
HOMES
That this city is being overran by
money-hungry developers is a
given, but why single out one?
Why not? These guys have
changed my old neighborhood
from a good place for a budding
misanthrope to grow up in, to a
nesting place for monster homes.
I laugh every time one of these
empty monuments to capitalist
excess gets broken-into by appliance-stealing thieves.
LI KAI-SHING
Billionaire owner of the Expo

that Premier FantasyZalm
handed him this prime piece of

don't you just get the feeling
that this rumoured triad big-

ABDUAL KHALIM
A former employer and owner
of the two biggest money-making hotels in the province. Hotels that introduced showers and

ANYONE WHO THINKS
THE EAST VAN HOUSE
SQUATTERS REPRESENT THE PLIGHT OF

Homeless people on the downtown east side and displaced senior citizens represoit the home-
less situation, not some middle-

decided to play anarchist. Do you
really think the police would've
been able to do their Gestapo
impression on these people if
they'd maybe tried cutting the
lawn, doing the gardening and
painting the fence instead of
building a barricade?
PAT CARNEY
Former Conservative MP now
a Senator. The epitome of pork

attitude. Her notion of serving
the public includes collecting a

Time&
haven't changed. Van-
d into a cyclical
le destined to re-
• peat itself every few
years. New kids come
and go but the casualties remain. Fuckin' huffed-out, dried-out junkies slumped over in an East
Side cafe shaking an empty coffee cup; hair that has died from
being badly cut, coloured and spiked once to often; arms and
knuckles covered in spidery green homemade tattoos that barely
cover the needle tracks; a brain that was at its intellectual peak
yelling "Fuck You!" at the cops trying to break up a rowdy
Buddha show a decade ago. You resisted the urge to hock the
studded jacket with Crass on the back but everything else has
been sold or lost. The chains, the bullet belt, the boots and the
pawnshop guitarf rom that band you started a long time ago. Yup,
the stories you could tell ifyou could just remember. About the
good old days, the Rat's Nest in Victoria, the Buddha and Stalag
in Vancouver, the time Black Flag played at what is now
Richards on Richards, all the legendary punk houses you lived in
overthe years, all yourold friends. Man, I envy you; you were the
scene. You were there, beginning to end; a veritable punk rock
god. Now, when you scrape up the quarters to go see a show,
nobody will even stand next to you.
But things being the way they be, kids are still attracted to
that despicably dirty entity, punk rock. Oh sure, il's changed and
evolved over the years into a generic profusion of rampant
labelling and backslabbing, but still, the basic components remain. Cruise any suburb late at night and you'll see them, the
burgeoning embryos of the new scene. They skate around convenience store parking lots with T-shirts ordered out of thrasher
magazines, showing today's superheroes oryesterday's legends.
The classic Holiday in Cambodia, the Sid Is Dead shirt, or just the
basic Flag bars, all printed on 50/50 Screen Stars competing for
space in the 7-11 skank-a-thon with heavy-duty Beefy Ts proudly
screened with Judge, Chain of Strength or Youth of Today.
Who's cooler? The kids with the dyed hair, silver skull jewelry,
musty dark clothes and Export A breath vs the straight edge crew
with fingers nimble after a night of WWF video wrestling,
drinking orange juice, and saying thank you to the guy at 7-11.
Oh, the blood to be shed! One side hands off uncreased SI50
leather biker jackets emblazoned with crisp paintings of the
Misfits' skull to their girlfriends who hand back busted beerbot-
tles to cut up the other crew who, meanwhile, carefully fold up
hooded sweats and exchange them with THEIR girlfriends for
broken Clearly Canadian bottles.
In reality, however, these disparate groups raising hell in
parking lots never face off in a gladatorial battle to the finish. A
greater evil kills them: apathy. Six months of hanging out in the
7-11 parking lot wears you down: you've skated all the curbs
there are to skate, you've listened to the same Discharge/Shelter
tape a zillion times, even your mom is no longer shocked at your
wacky antics. Besides that, punk rock doesn't fit in with roller
blading.
Like a bad rerun, this scene, too, will drift into the void, the
leftovers using a retro lifestyle to cling to a vestige of parking lot
glory. The scene is dead. Long live the scene. I hear there's
another one right around the corner.

It was a time of great confusion.
Yes, that's right, and we're all in

It's like a dream I had recently. I
was a successful stockbroker. I
had a condo on Granville Island.
I had a beautiful wife I sort of
loved. I think we had children
but they kept to the background.
Everything was going fine 'til I

alone. I thought I was tuning in

was wrong—

"Are there ghosts, Piggy?

"Of course there aren't."
"Why not?"
"Because things wouldn't

"But what if things don't

An Academic-type is addressing a lecture hall full of attentive
students. His attitude is flippant,
almost arrogant. We pick him up
in mid-sentence: "Simply the
idea that things have causes, that
we live in an ordered world, that

are lots of explosions and two

guys just get their guns shot out
of their hands.
A White North American Adult
Male, conservatively dressed,

BLACK (it's not acolour per se;
it's the presence of all colours).
Suffice it to say, the dream is
now a full-blown infinity nightmare. This is sleep after all. The
rules of Time and Space no longer apply. The black hole that
used to be your television now
consumes your entire living
room. You sit on your couch and
suffer forever—
UNTIL YOU WAKE UP.
You stick your head through
the smashed front window and
scream at the empty neighbourhood—"WHAT THE FUCK IS
GOING ON?" But the only response comes from the TV—
smashed to pieces on the sidewalk, but it's still working. "Our
cause is just. Our cause is moral. Our cause is right." But now
there's something new on the
soundtrack. Subtle at first, barely audible, but it's getting louder. Black laughter—sick,
wracked with pain. It's pure,
blood-curdling malevolence—
IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT
YOU FINALLY DO WAKE
UP!
Black and White documentary
footage focuses on a young boy
in a typical 1960s suburban
kitchen. He looks kind of like
The Beaver. He speaks hesitantly. "You're introduced to
LSD and unless you've taken
some other drug like—uhhhh,
marijuana or something, well,
you know, it's an altogether
new thing. And uhhh—you actually can have a religious experience and it can be evenmore
important than reading the Bible six times or becoming a
Pope or something like that—"
A very British Narrator interrupts the flow: "At Millbrook,
children as young as nine were
given LSD."

It's the first North American

It was all just a nightmare you
realize. You fell asleep on the
couch while watching The Gulf
War onTV. Hell, PresidentBush
himself is speaking. It's one of
those State of the Union occasions. The War is ten or so days
old and the time is ripe to come
clean on what exactly is going
down. "This we do know," says
George. "Our cause is just. Our
cause is moral. Our cause is
right."
And then rapturous applause explodes through the auditorium.
But something is wrong. The
broadcast is going wonky.
George is repeating himself.
"Our cause is just. Our cause is
moral. Our cause is right." Over
and over again—like a stuck
record. It dawns on you that the
nightmare isn't over after all. In
fact, you're stuck in one those
dream-within-a-dream scenarios. You try to change the channel, but it's the same thing on all
stations. You try to turn the TV
off, but no such luck. Just more
George. So you unplug it, but
the box keeps talking.
Panic is creeping up your spine.
You pick up the TV, raise it over
your head and toss it through the
front window of your condo to
the sidewalk two storeys below.
It feels good suddenly, this act of
almost sacrilegious violence.
Kind of like listening to Slayer
on your Walkman while walking through a churchyard. Hold
on a second. SLAYER? You're
a stockbroker. You have a wife
and kids. You don't listen to
Slayer. You don't even know
what Death-Metal is.
That is, I—who am
nor ever have been, a stockbroker. It was all just a dream remember. I fell asleep watching
a Vincent Price flick on the late
show.Idon'townacondo.Hell,
I can't even afford rent. But I
did do LSD when I was nine
and nothing's been the same
since (there's a lie if I've ever
heard one).
Truth is, there is no truth anymore. Maybe there never was,
but the illusion was at least occasionally convincing. The Gulf
War was just a TV show—a
smokescreen for the Real War
which is a hell of a lot closer to
home. Fact is, we're fighting it
right now, aren't we? IT'S IN
YOUR FACE.It'sin your brain.
It's deep in the marrow of your
fucked up modern soul. It's inner conflict, inferiority complex, nervous tension, the habit
of worry. It's your deepest,
darkest, most debilitating fear.
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.
It's 1991—last decade of the
second millenium—and I don't
know about you, but I'm seeing
more evidence of state-sponsored, institutionalized cannibalism every day. Viva Discorder.

26   THE lOOTH DISCORDER
ROVING EAR
This month from
adBlightye
by PJ. Tilwyche,
Emotionally uack-
mailed into blowing $800 on a
trip back to dear old Blighty to
see various elderly relatives, I
reconciled myself with the fact
that at least I'd get exposed to
some trendy new bands and
maybe pick up some impossi-
ble-to-get-in-Vancouver CDs.
So, having arrived, drunk off
the jet lag with pints of Hook
Norton, and shown Granny my
photos, I set off to find out what
was going on musically. Where
to start? Good question. Obviously with the Radio, right?
Well, in the U.K., there's basically one radio station for "popular" music, appropriately
enough called Radio One. This
is run by the BBC, which also
runs Radio Two (housewife Valium favourites), Radio Three
(bourgeois Valium classical),
Radio Four (news, plays, comedy and impossibly bad soap operas with oxbridge accents).
There's also a network of inde- .
pendent regional stations which
mix the lamest
of Radio One's
playlist with
Radio Two fod-
back  to Radio
especially as there's no other
outlet for popular music. This
goes for independent record labels and "alternative*'bands too.
There is no alternative to Radio
One: if you want to make any
money in music, you have to get
on and to get on you have to get
into the singles chart. Due to
Britain's regulated mass media,
the singles charl is a vitally important indicator of the UK music scene, completely different
from Canada where few people
their country's best-sell-
:. In Britain, literally
from Goths to Grants the "Number One,"
all sit down on a Sun-
fning to hear the chart i
n (you guessed it)
The pressure to get
(ingles chart usually actor the taming of many
bands. New bands
gauge their success by the position of their latest single, gradually changing into chart dino- .
saurs like Queen or Phil Coll
Abba! The monopoly of "The
Big One" assures capitulation
by even the so-called alterjjl-
tives: The Happy Mondjlfs
pulled the lines "Gonna buy an
airforce base, gonna wipe oul
your race" at Radio One's bidding, while The KLF removed
their gunfire sample from "3am
Eternal" in order to get airplay.
Sometimes this backfires on the
Beeb. Frankie's "Relax" was
going nowhere until an over-
zealous Radio One DJ announced lhat he wasn't going to -
play Mf"smut" anymore. Res
through the rj
"rankie got a number
\the BBC refused t<
pioneered byj
._„.. Think about
second: the British^
the BBC, that same public v
in cash to make a record the
best-seller in the UK... and the
BBC won't play it. Weird or
what?
The most influential  national TV exposure for a band
One.
This
state-owned and
has the monop-
little
at does get
piss-poor
which is a bless
ing, I guess-
but the new mu:
dance pop pap, chosen, I'm
sure, by faceless, out-of-touch
bureaucrats, solely for it's lack
of ability to offend anyone.
Something like 10 million
people listen to Radio One, so
you can imagine that THE
RECORD BUSINESS is very
keen to get its product played.
Frankie's "Relax" was going nowhere until an over-
zealous Radio One DJ announced that he wasn ft
going to play that "smut"
anymore. Ik
And to enjoy the-honour (and
publicity) of being on this show,
you have to be going up rhe
singles chart!
This is all adding up to a
pretty dodgy situation for new
bands, non-commercial music
and small lji
ford payola to those guardia
of public
not lost! There are still ways
for young and exciting bands to

Thanks to the efforts
id determination of Radio
One's only decent, sane and un-
cringeworthy DJ, John Peel,
who actually listens to thousands of new demos every week,
some good music manages to
escape onto national airwaves.
The John Peel Show is an oasis
in a desert of shit. BBC 2 (the
arty minority TV channel) hosts
late-night shows where bands
such as the Cranes and the
Throwing Muses get to play

This being Discorded
100th issue, subtext turns its roving
eye upon... Vancouver! Local artists
Colin Upton and Rick Gibson to be
exact. Rick, of "Sniffy" fame, supplies his answerto People Are Reading—and also gives us a history lesson. Colin, who recently hit the big
time with a Fantagraphics release/
deal—after years of putting out his
own-mini comics—shared lunch to
discuss his comic projects and inter-
Parents, however well-meaning, can
often be wrong. Colin Upton's mom
felt he should learn a trade... vacuum
cleaner repair, perhaps? Uh, no
thanks mom—at 19,heoptedforthe
Vancouver School of Art (later
known as Emily Carr) instead. At a
teacher's urging, Colin took 2nd year
twice, spending the time solely on
drawing and anatomy classes. A cartoonist since childhood as therapy
for dyslexia, Colin was getting good!
Aspart of the small press scene,
Colin began to print his mini-comics
in 1985, the first titles being Granville Street Gallery (portraits of assorted mall rats, punks and religious
zealots) and Socialist Turtle (a very
cranky Marxist-Leninist turtle and
his much-nicer pals).
Many mini-comics later, Co
lin got the urge for bigger things.
Renowned local artist, Ed Varney,
basically stated the obvious: Why
didn't Colin put out his own regular-
size comic? Would Varney bankroll
the project? Yep. With the commitment of three Gs (for 3,000 copies),
the two lumbered their way through
Big Thing's release with advice
from David Boswell (of Reid Hemming fame) and others. Colin Up-
ton'sBig Thing has sold about 1,500
copies; pretty good for an independent small press book.
The introduction to Big Thing
is by Harvey Pekar, the American
cartoonist whose autobiographical
style heavily influenced Colin's
work. The stories are all true slice-
of-life: a New Year's concert/riot
with Ogre; a spooky store clerk in
"loonys"; crossing the US border
and more. Funny and touching, never dull.
Colin Upton's Other Big
Thing was recendy released by Fantagraphics, Colin's new publisher.
Based out of Seattle, Fantagraphics
will be publishing Colin's stuff four
times a year—great in terms of recognition/distribution in the world of
words and pictures.
UnlikeBigThing.Colin'sOth-
er Big Thing has a mix of fiction
along with the autobiography. "In-
catpacitated," about a guy who
awakes one mom to find his cat has
crawled into his head, is fantasy,
while "What I Know About Sikhs" is
the writer's history of his neighborhood in Little India. Other tales include "I'm Not English," explaining
how Upton developed a quasi -accent
from years of Monty Python and
BBC listening; "Pay-Phone"is about
that infamous loser who calls a downtown phone and requests strange
favours. "Stalingrad," a tale of demons and war, went over my head,
but proves Colin is turning his attention towards historical writings.
The next Big Thing, entitled
Colin Upton's Other Slightly
Smaller Big Thing, should be out
this month. Its regular-size comic
book format will contain a complete
story in one issue: the true saga of
when the Haters performance group
went to the Slates and were arrested
for trespassing in a state park on
Whidby Island.

PEOPLE   ARE    READING
Ever wonder what people are reading? I do. Rick Gibson, who is very pleasant, took time to write and tell subtext.
A couple of months ago, I gave away 100 Canadian $2 bills aspart of astreet event
in downtown Vancouver. On each ofthe banknotes, the British queen's portrait
had been covered with white paint The words "GET RID OFTHE QUEEN" were
written over lop of the paint.
The purpose of this event was to draw into question the use of British royal
images as official Canadian symbols.
Much of the thinking behind this event came from an article I read by S.M.
Lipset entitled, "Revolution and Counterrevolution: The United States and
Canada" (this article is part of an anthology of essays about Canadian society,
entitled Passion and Identity by Mandel and Taras). Lipset postulates that the
American Revolution was a key factor in shaping the modern character of
English-speaking central Canada
At the end of the American Revolution, about 100,000 loyalist refugees left
the US and fled north to Canada. Here, they re-established British institutions
with British symbols. Images of British royalty were officially used to symbolically differentiate elitist and law abiding central Canadians from the populist and
radical Americans.
I went to the library and flipped through a few books on the history of the
United Empire Loyalists. There's no doubt about it; some of them had a terrible
time before they fled the United States. They had their property seized, they were
attacked by republican vigilantes and they were forced to restart a much harsher
life on the central Canadian frontier.
Lipset proposes that the world's "oldest anti-Americans" have clung to their
British symbols because of their 200-year-old fear of American republicai
These symbols are rarely questioned, regardless of how obsolete they are, bei
it is believed that the only alternative is a political and cultural void which v
be quickly filled by the US.
For most of the time since Confederation, English-speaking central Canada
has set the agenda for this nation. It has federally reproduced its institution
stamped them with its symbols. Its fears of American domination have resull
national policies which encourage political, economic and cultural protectioi
Fear, rather than pride, is the driving force behind this country.
This research into the history of English-speaking central Canadamac
curious about British Columbia's history. I found George Woodcock's "British
Columbia: A History of the Province" a good introduction.
The history of this province is quite different from that of central Canadr
To begin with, it was not settled by refugees who had lost a war. As a result, th
outlook of British Columbians is more positive and self-confident than that of
central Canadians. There is no grand fear of the US or republicanism. If anything,
it is developing its own unique sense of nationhood.
No doubt, with lime, this province could create ils own images, institutions
and nation. It no longer needs the inappropriate British symbols imposed by
central Canada. Nor does il need the meaningless name "British Columbia'
was chosen by the unimaginative Queen Victoria

HARDCORE!!!
The evening of April 6th was an
eventful one for the Gest Quest Co-
Op and for all the folks who attended
their five-band hardcore blowout in
North Van.
I missed the Deprogrammers
but I did catch the rest of the show.
Ten Feet Tall was up second and
although these guys arcpretty young,
theirfuture holds great things if they
can stick it out. The bass player's
sound was something that really got
me; it jumped out at you instead of
being a plain, heavy sound. Perfectly capturing the spirit of an all-ages
gig, Ten Feet Tall played a solid set
of fast songs without getting boring.
Spark Marker was the thirdband to
hitthestageandtu med ou l to be a bi t
disappointing. The word is they're
like Fugazi: an expectation virtually
impossible to live up to. Except for
the last one, their songs were uninteresting but it was an off-night for
guitarist Kim Kinakin, so maybe that
was part ofthe problem. Sludge, the
fourth band ofthe night, started their
slow heavy hot set with a few songs
lead by their former singer. It's too
bad he couldn't stay with the band
because he really was excellent: a
screamer but with a low voice from
the gut—pits of hell type. After this,
the present-day Sludge vocalist took
over. Having two singers is a cool
and original idea, however, they
didn't have the really interesting
voices or crazy moves to take full
advantage of it. After Sludge finished up, Cat's Game got ready.
After a while, the curtain opened to
reveal a huge backdrop painting of a
gas-masked creature with the reflec-
lenses. That was nothing compared
to the impact of the costumes the
band was wearing. They (guitar, bass,
drummer, singer) each had a hand-
painted jumpsuit type thing and a
white stocking on the head with the
eyes, nose and mouth cut out. These
guys are DEVO from hell. Describing their stage show is easy: excellent punk songs, great sound, awesome costumes and a frontman with
wickedmoves. Unfortunately,Cat's
Game's set was rudely interrupted
by certain individuals who were denied entrance to the show. These
hoodlums decided to take action by
breaking the glass in the front door.
Consequently, everyone went to the
entrance to get a closer look. The
lights went on, the band stopped
playing, thelandlord
The next
onstage^
the advice
"remain in the building." Thr
ing losers responsible were holed up
at the motel across the street and Ae
possibility of knives, guns, rifles,
nuclear weapons had not been ruled
out. It was pretty exciting. When my
friends and I finally left, there were
no less than five cop cars parked in
front of the hall or at the motel across
the street. A few days later, 1 went
down to the Vancouver Police station on Main to get the facts, but
getting my hand s on the repo rt lurncd
out to be a little much in the way of
a hassle. "Do you have any media
ID?""NTo,ConstableJones,Idon't."
I'd liketosuckwithGest-Qucst
Co-op for a bit because it deserves
some special aitention. Ifyou don't
know anything about it, here's a
broken-down version of the pamphlet they've put out. The (oiks at
Gest Quest arc trving to get non-
; ore shows performed on
a regular basis while keeping four
basic guidelines in mind:
1. no drugs/alcohol
3. no racist/sexist attitude
4. all ages
Once a show is planned, the band
line-up is to be drawn at random
with each band receiving equal pay.
All money will be pumped back into
future shows wiuie ihc profits wit!
go to Ihe band unless it's a benefit
concert. I'm happy to say that the
show on the 6th sold out and earned
the Co-op's bank account $ 1000 for
the purchase of better PA equipment, etc. An excellent way for local
hardcore bands to get some exposure. From an audience point of view,
it'll give you a break from beerpric-
es no one can afford and people who
don't give a shit about the band
they're watching unless it's one of
theirpersonal favorites. At this show,
every band had a sincere bunch of
thrashers in front of them. If you'd
hke to give Gest-Quest a hand, give
them a call at 525-3570. They need
you and Vancouver needs this.
On the 5th, I saw Rollcage for
the firsttime, opening up for NOFX.
To narrow it down, they were playing Doughboys- style friendly rock
n' roll without being lameass. Original songs with clean, catchy riffs:
there's nothing hke having two guitars sounding really connected while
putting out heavy, warm chords.
Elvis Lovechild could certainly leam something from Rollcage. I
caught most of the Elvis set at the
Hog show on April 8th when I should
have been watching Canucks' overtime. Atfirstldefinitely heard something that attracted my attention, but
when I got closer to the Lovechild, I
found a band with their amps at the
wrong settings. These guys were
going for an abrasive sound when
they shouldn' t have been. The props
and the film they had were cool, but
their sloppy sound bit the big one.
The Hog brothers wereupnext,
but too late did I realize that I've just
plain seen them too many times.
Baby Hog kicked ass as usual by
smashing a glass right off the bat,
rolling around on it and then scraping a piece of it over his belly. His
arm was bleeding, his tit was bleeding—shit, man, that's good entertainment! Terry was really pounding that night too, but the problem is,
they need to throw more new songs
into Ihe lineup. Theyhadanew thing
called "the Intro" to start the set,
which was definitely up to Hog standard, but there's gotta be more.
Hamm Hog and the guitar brothers
said they have some new stuff but
it's just not ready for an audience
yet; I think the Town Pump on a
rainy Monday night is a good time to
take some chances. Other items in
this month's Hog Report includenew
management under Mint Records'
Bill Baker. Old friends meets good
business deal? Hope so. The Hog
brothers intend lo tour Canada in
mid-May and then swing down into
the east coast Stales lo tag -team with
some Sub Pop band, preferably ol'
man TAD. Unfortunately, the European TADHOG tour fell through
due lo a ycllabelly booking agent
possibility of a 7" in the fall, so keep
your fingers crossed^KJ*
IhismomhV'LocalBandGets
Good  Show   Award"  goes   to
pearance under its belt, the band has
ia i Jed [he opening job for   '     ,
coming Poison Idea/Melvins show
at the Cruel Elephant on May 12.
Way to go, you lucky fuckers!!
Soulcharge are in the studio
recording their second tape but
they're breaking with Victoria tradition by actually contemplating a vinyl release. Also, the band will hopefully be releasing a split 7" wilh
Vancouver's own Paste (who have
yet to play a gig as far as I know) on
Chikara Records sometime in the
near future. Gotta love those well-
defined record-release dates.
Now it's time for the. long-
awaited Wongs bio. Why do they
get it? Because they rock with original songs, that's why, and don't let
anyone tell you different unless
you 've seen and heard them foryour-
self.
Bandmembers are Dr. Pig (vocals), Kevin Rose (S.G.), Ralph Allan (bass) and KerrBeliveau (drams).
Ralph and Kevin had been successfully jamming for two years when
they got together with Doug Donut.
As good as Doug was, things didn't
work out so along came Kerr. This
time the magic was still there, leaving only the singing portion of the
band unfilled. It was at a Forgotten
Rebels show that the band was introduced to ex-SNFUer Ken Chin.
After coming up with some good
stuff at their first jam, the Pig decided to move to our fair city and thus
the Wongs were bom.
Theirfirst show was excellent:
green, plaster-type shit on the rhythm
faces, a sharp three-piece on the guitarist and the Chi-ness popping oul
of a hand-painted, puffed-wheat-
filled asbestos suit. Fuck yeah!
Spunk never should have gotten on
stage.
As far as recording goes, the
Wongs want to have a lot of songs to
choose from before putting out their
first album. They've had a few offers, but so far a deal with Cargo
Records is the only one they're seriously considering. Independent vs.
commercial release is the Wongs'
present dilemma. The technical end
of their recording situation is well
underway, with a studio being built
in Kevin's basement. They've got
the twelve track, they've got the
Cecil English connection and they've
got quality hard rock. When the
Wongs have a disc, il will be a good
thing. Their next show is with the
Goo Goo Dolls and the 'Shells on
May 3, followed by a possible all-
agers the next night at the Lux, featuring Octatractcr, Gorilla Gorilla
and maybe Rollcage. If the Gorilla
can drop their new-found fame and
fortune crap and get down to some
raw hardcore business, it should be a
really hot line-up.
In closing, a personal message
from me and the Tom. If you've got
a demo, if you've got information, if
you've got upcoming shows, if
you've got GUEST LISTS, then we
want to know about it. Special's our
name, Vancouver's our game, and
we want to help. Until next month—
ROCK OUT.
< FUTURE
BY ADAM SLOAN
III this edition of Future Rap,
I look at what's happening locally;
I'll get back to the reviews again
next month. If you don't see your
name here and you're doing something, send me some information
and a tape (if you have one) c/o this
column,Discorder Magazine, Room
233, 6138 SUB Blvd, V6T1Z1.
The biggest thing I know of
happening in Vancouveris EQ, who
are Ease and Quase, originally from
the American Gulf Islands but now
based here. They've released a vinyl
EP and a cassette EP, and have
opened up for a few rap acts, including Public Enemy. EQ's "Put Your
Body In It" received airplay on
LG73—a pretty good accomplishment for anyone. Pete Finesse and
Showbiz—who are also being
played on LG73 with their song
"Where You At!"—were formerly
known as Somethin' Smooth and
Ricky Dee; Somethin' Smooth, a/k/
a Neil Scobie, started CiTR's firsl
all-rap show. In Effect. Terror T
and the Beat Assassinator released
a full-length cassette last fall and
won best MC at CiTR's DJ Sound-
war. BZ Jam and the Urban Brotherhood Committee are kickin'
around some demos, as are The Eskimo Tribe. Craig Crush and First
Offence have been doing a lot of
shows in clubs, and just landed a
deal with Flex Management of
Toronto. Most of these people have
more stuff coming out soon so keep
yourears open. Othergroups comin'
up include Chaz EB and Code
Black, Killa D and DJ Force, the
Invincible Rhyme Society, and
King V. Give the scene a few more
years and it could be lookin' good.
Presently, CiTR FM 101.9 has
two rap shows: In Effect, Saturdays
3-5 pm and Megablasl!, Thursday
nights 1-4 am. CJIV 93.9 FM cable
has Soul Sonic Shocks 9-12 Friday
nights and CFRO FM 102.7 has a hip
hop show Wednesday nights, 9-12.
And finally, a few interesting
facts about rap in Vancouver. The
first big rap competition was the DJ
Soundwar, held by CiTR here at
UBC last September—by the way,
Part II will be held this September,
so start thinking about it now if you
want to enter. Also of note, the first
four rap acts to come io Vancouver
were: Grandmaster Flash, summer,
1984; The Fat Boys, August, 1988;
Boogie Down Productions, August,
1988; and Ice-T, August, 1989.
This month's best rap comes
from Stetsasonic'sfi/ood, Sweat and
No Tears album. Slammin'!

the commodore ballroom is the grand old dame of Vancouver's night circuit, she flourished in the forties when people used to go and dance to big bands, sometime since then, the
