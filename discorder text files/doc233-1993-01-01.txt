it? How often will fake i.d. work

kind of advice gives such shiny
options and then defeats them with
pessimism? Throughout your whole
response you explaines how all

that they can work and do work—
just not with your "help." You
may as well have just laughed in

SPARKS  R FLYIN'
Dear Airhead,
In r
"High
garding
It seems lhal ihere is a lack of all-
ages shows as well as a lack of
support for all-ages shows. Having been involved with putting on
all-ages shows, witnessing the prob-
lems, struggles and hardships in
volved with them, i thought lhat il
would be appropriate forme lo comment on the "age limit" arguement,
in defence of the freedom for people
of all ages to see shows.
It bothers me lhat you probably nevcrsupportall-ages shows,
except for the cool ones where
everyone you know is going, but
still, as a veteran punk, feel that
you have earned the right to give
advice on the no minors vs. all-
19. Maybe we try to forget the
injustices when we turn 19. I'm 21
and i hale lo make statements, but
i refuse to "grow-up" if it means
escapmg reality ie. hanging out al
9 to 5 at a job i hate—and convincing myself that il's a good job, or
silting at home in front of the television criticizing the world while
refusing lo be involved with it. I'm
human, i make mistakes, but i won'l
's been giv.
and say it tasles good.
To quote you: "...face the
fact that money is the bottom line;
music is a business."
to sell iheir product. That's whal
bars do—they use music and musicians lo sell beer. The fact that a
"alternative"—don't be fooled lo
think lhat the clubowners care about
the music, for them liquor sales
are the bottom line. You make it
seem that we should feel sorry for
even thinking lhat bars suck, i am
The fact thai ihey are oflen the
only place for bands to play just
displays the pathetic laziness of
those who claim membership io
and complain—do you really think
it would take too much effort to
makethmgs different? Believeme,
kirn kinakin
My thoughts on "Trips'
Sparkmarker review. Yeah,
Sparkmarker are greal. Perhaps
the only great band in Vancouver
right now.
Maybe my gripe with the review is lhat the Nappy Dugout is
lauded as the coolest venue in town.
Okay, maybe it's cool, but are you
aware of what a "Nappy Dugoul"
is? A vagina. Let me nit-pick for a
while. Perhaps Shakey (ND proprietor) likes Ice Cube a lol. Being
male, I may be full of shit, but I'm
pretly sure I'd feel uncomfortable
enough lo nol frequent the ND if I
was female. Il disappoints me lo
see that the skateboard crowd alien-
ales women like this when skaters
(especially under-19 skaters) are
alienated and have been for as
long as I've been skating. I say
"under-19 skaters" because they
have il the worst, as far as going
and seeing bands goes.
Perhaps it's wrong for me
to blame the whole "skateboard
crowd" for the actions of one
skater, and perhaps he didn't think
ofthe name because he's a skater.
It jusl seems lo me thai young
thing to stick their dicks in when
they're not out ollieing something. It bugs me to see that nobody clues in to the sexist re-
money on it, so his heart is in the
rightplace, although his brain mighl
nol be. I'll rant some more when
my band plays there and I have
some real power.
Oh yeah. Sparkmarker. I was
going to cut up Trip's review,
mainly because I don't understand
the comparisons lo Suicidal, All
or Pavement, but I won'l do that. I
get really bossy and opinioi

pretty damn original since I first
saw them 2 years ago and while
they're much harder + heavier
now, they still defy description.
English just doesn't do them justice. So Trip's comparisons
bugged mc, but lhats okay. Trip
wrole and I didn't, and anyone
can write for Discorder.
As far as the crowd being
sedate, I fully disagree. Maybe
my body was still, but my SOUL
was on FIRE and I felt I was

..nineteen-ninety-two. by Dan MOUfe. [§2**L
Nineteen-ninety-two.. .Ahh.. .nineteen-ninety-two.
Almost two thousand years after that big bad dude with a crucifix and hokus-
pokus water came down(or up?) to this dreary little planet, we're still here
grovelling in our self-pitty. Well, this particular year has seen auite a few memorable events take place. Certain Gods and Demi-Gods have visited our humble
little home. Gods such as the Cure and Morrissey(2?) and even J.A.M.C. For those
of you who like U2, I'll throw them in there too.
But wait, that's not all. It can slice, dice, cut, chop and blend even the
toughest of vegetables. 1992 has also seen the big outdoors show...um...was it
Lollipoplooza or something like that? "It was a smashing show combining the best of
today's modern music..." Personally, my favourite part was watching the rain wash the
"permanent" blue dye out of people's hair. The fun began when the "permanent" dye
ran down the people's faces which magically transformed their skin into a beautiful
shade of blue resembling that of rigamortis.
Speaking of Magic, didn't that basketball player guy retire twice due to some sort of
disease he got (it's called AIDS, Dan. Ed) after having sex with...oh, roughly...TONS of
women? Wow, imagine that, who would have thought you could get that disease that
way? Personally, I'm still for the dirty tiolet seat theory. I should not trivialize a disease so
serious as the one he has unfortunately become a victim of, but one has to wonder why
when a non-celebrity gets this thing, they are avoided like the bubonic plague. But when
that magician guy gets it, he's a hero and people run up and shake his hand. Wow, what
a role-model I
Now that we're on the topic of sports, 1992 has also seen the arrest and conviction
of that loveable, huggable, adorable and irresistable Mike Tyson guy. Obviously, Mike
suffers too many blows to the head because the auditory cortex part of his brain received
an, "Oh, please do," when she said, "No!" I wonder how he's doing now...?
Onto bigger things, 1992 unfolded the continued changes for the better(?)
for the former Eastern Bloc. To think that ass wipe (excuse me, "sanitary tissue,")
costs more than Rubles is mind blowing. Or how about the bickering in former
Yugoslavia? If only they would have been fortunate enough to have some oil
wells, boy, those good capitalist Americans would have been ther to save the
day months ago.
On the round trip back home, 1992 has seen Doctor Master make his first
billion. For those of you who are still wondering what the TRUE definition of that
weird music style...Ah...Um, Alternative is, 1992 has discovered that also.
al»ter»na«tive: buying those shoes that made Mr. Marten so rich, then sandpapering them so as to make them look old. Then saying you got them when the
Sex Pistols (who?) were still around.(ie: it's the image, not the feeling, c'mon
people!)
The big sight for 1992 was that referendum bit. It's very sad to see that we
spent $130 million on something that has resolved nothing. No hardfeelings
against the politicians, but it would have been nice to spend that money on the
homeless or real hair dye and new Doc's.
I suppose I've sounded a tad more cynical than I've intended to, but, all in
all, 1992 hasn't been too shabby. I mean, who can complain about a year in
which Benetton adds portrayed that little chicken doing the 100 meter breast-
stroke through the Exxon oil spill for the sole purpose of selling more clothes?
Perhaps 1993 will be as eventful as '92. Who knows, maybe Michael Jackson
will be at the next Lollipop thing or maybe we can teach America how to mount
flags properly. But then again, maybe Elvis and Jack Kennedy are still alive and
forming a conspiracy to buy out Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. PLEA

RENEGADE tfUWOS Qf>OUP Well, it has finally ended. A winner has been crowned and Shindig's work is done for yet another
year. It took 13 weeks, 27 local
bands, 2 venues, 4 MCs, 2 photographers, 11 writers, 44 judges,
88 judge's beer, a whole gaggle
of good and even worse jokes, 78
Jokes For Beer beer, countless
broken hearts and the assistance
and attendance of too many folks
to even begin to start mentioning
on these consecrated pages.
That's it, we're tired, see 'ya in
•93.
Monday November 16
I caught a few Shindig shows last
year and the one on Nov. 16th
was surely the oddest. Although
no Tragically Hip/Pearl Jam icky-
rawk wannabes twitched about
onstage, this time, the music
turned out to be pretty blah none-
the-less. Had I been a judge on
this night 1 would have picked the
first band —which dumbly featured the word "cervix" [Not In
Cervix] in their name—as the
winner: a pleasant mix of ska/
punk. Band members included
an excellent guitarist, gangly singer and a real bonehead drummer
(Sir, it's extremely bad form to
carry on greeting pals and lady-
friends as you did while another
band is playing a showcase). I
couldn't make out the lyrics but
can easily picture this troupe playing all-ages hall gigs. Highlight
of the night for moi.
As for the second band,
Mickey O' Love.yikes! They
were awful. With songs about
drugs (they took the "anti" position), bad family relations, and
odes to talk show hosts Sally Jesse
Raphael and Geraldo, this was
truly bad rock opera. I like to
support groups that play Shindig,
it takes energy, commitment and
a certain fearlessness to get up in
front of a bunch of folks, however, these songs were so wretched
in content that I couldn't muster
thcencrgy toclap between songs.
The third band (and winners), Howard vs. Willy, were
adequate. I was quite surprised
they won. A tight trio with snare-
heavy drums and rather lacklus
ter, why-yes-I-am-a-slacker vocals, I deemed 'em okay. I'll admit I left after a few songs (a
combination of a need for sleep
and an overdose of second-hand
smoke) but did I miss much? Per-
James Oslerberg
Semi-final Action
Monday November 23
This week in the continuing
trilogy of Shindig marked the
beginning of the semi-finals.
Once again, the Railway Club
played host to Stick Monkey,
Meet Daisy & Ten Feet Tall. 1
had seen Stick Monkey play
once before at an outdoor concert in Kamloops, where the
headlining band was none other
than D.O.A., and though they
were good then they're even
better now. Stick Monkey
played powerful instrumentals
that were nicely backed up by
the lead female singer's melodic voice. The guitarists
active performance left some
of  us   in  awe  and   therefore
e finis
i 2nd
together well at all.
They just weren't my bowl of
preztels....
Svea Sjoberg
Monday November 30
First on the night's bill was
Movieland, a band I had been
wanting to see for a while,
and with their basement-Stone
:yle they didn't disappoint me at all. They play the
type of music that you could
to, apart from live, that
makes you feel happy and alive
without the scorching headache. Alan (lead vocalist, guitar) has a good voice but all
too often it was inaudible under the loud acoustics. Their
song "Burn You" is one ofthe
best songs I've heard in a good
from
al
Movieland was nothing short
of great, and after this night
we'll definitely bee hearing
them at the finals.

Nardwuar The Human Serviette's Top Ten Reasons To
Live (Nardwuar The Human Serviette 3:30-4:00PM Fri.)
1. Seeing Rockin Rod & the Strychnines, Potty Mouth, and
Unwound at a house party in Olympia.
2. Learning about Neil Young's wailing 1960's Winnipeg
based garage band, The Squires, from a great book called
Aurora, The Story of Neil Young and the Squires (Available from N YASD, 2a Llynfi Street, Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan
CF31 1st, Wales, UK.)
3. Reading 1 0 Things Jesus Wants you to Know fanzine.
No, this ain't full of Christian diatribe, just simple, honest
band interviews, intelligent record and show reviews, plus
it features a cool layout, and no bullshit major-label, fat-
folkie lame-ass ads. A great waste of time. Free in the
Seattle area, or from 1407 NE 45th St. #1 7, Seattle, WA
98105 USA.
4. Mecca Normal/Kreviss split 7 incher. This greenish disc
marks the first time Canadian bands have been featured
on Sub-Pop since Skinny Puppy reared its head on the
Sub Pop 100 compilation.
5. Drum sound on "99 Girls," by the Young Fresh Fellows,
from the It's Low Beat Time CD. Using the same studio
(Audio Recording) and same engineer (Kearney Barton)
as the Sonics, this recording is as close as anyone has
come to aping the true Northwest 60's punk feel; right up
there with the Mummies' version of "Tall Cool One." No
joke.
6. Victoria, B.C., Canada: home to tons of amazing bands
and not enough record labels, although the Blobs series
has been a great blessing to Vancouverites wanting to
hear fresh new vibes from the island. Garden City favourites include BUM, Mexican Power Authority, Fracas, Swell
Prod, Loot Bag, Contempt, Show Business Giants,
Closetman, Seat Belt, Pigment Vehicle, the Vinaigrettes,
Laffing Stock, Pressure Cooker, OTTG and Goat Boy.
There's also a cool record store, Funhouse, the intellectually stimulating Coercion 'zine( $1 from 2418 Dryfe St.,
Victoria, B.C., V8R 5T2) and the incredible Sam's Deli.
7. The Monks. A group of ex-American serviceman living
in Germany during the 1960's started this far out combo.
Dressed in black with heads shaved like monks, these
dudes played violent, brutal, near insane music. Quite
possibly the strangest group to ever take form, dig their
story in Ugly Things magazine (405 W. Washington St.
#237, San Diego, CA 921 03 USA) put out by Mike Stax of
beat-lords, The Hoods.
8. All-ages gigs at the Nappy Dugout and continued
'quality" rock performances at the Cruel Elephant.
9. Fiz. A new "blah blah blah" magazine from L.A., which
so hip it even prints letters that Discorder Gawd, Paul t.
Brooks, has sent to the editor. Six issue sub available for
$20 (U.S.) to P.O. Box 67E27, L.A., CA 90067 USA.
0. Local releases that continue to flow: Sparkmarker,
Drone, Indecisives, Superconductor, Lung, Thee Crusaders, cub, Facepuller, Pork Queen, The Sweaters, Cat's
Game, Tankhog, Rattled Roosters, Fratracide, DOA, Hanson

What People Are Reading
Ever wonder what people are reading? I do. David 0s-
trem, one heckuva great artist, took the time to write and
tell subtext.
I just finished reading The Tin Drum by Gunter Grass. I
don't know what next but it will probably be something
American like Steinbeck or Faulkner. I don't have a lot
of time for reading but I always have a novel going and
it's always a modern classic from the nineteenth or
twentieth century. About six years ago I discovered that
good reading helped me organize my own mind which is
important in my profession (artist) because, as I'm sure
you've heard your artist type friends say, "I have, like, all
these ideas and it's not so easy to sort them out".
To keep things interesting, I also have a strategy for
jumping from country to country and from era toera. I'll go from
a Dostovesky, to a Sarte, to a Miller, to an English guy like
Forster. I might mix in the odd hard time, like Gulag with a guilty
pleasure like Graham Greene. Of course this kind of skipping
around can be difficult but it can also be good mental exercise.
The other big reason for reading, for me, is because of the
importance of words in my pictures. It's important that I
carefully study uses and effects of language from as many view
points as possible.
This word and picture stuff comes from my childhood as a comic book reader in Portland, Oregon in the
fifties. I still take a keen interest in comics, especially
those which evolved from the Zaps and other undergrounds from San Francisco. I often wonder if some of
these cartoonists aren't the best artists. In fact, there is
very little gallery art that I respect as much as the work
of K. Crumb, S.Clay Wilson, Kim Deitch, Justin Green,
and relative newcomers like Charles Burns, Kaz, and
Drew Friedman.
Humor is important in ray work so all this comic
reading is very beneficial. My greatest inspiration in
this field is the incomparable Krazy and Ignatz by
George Harriman. I am fascinated by his ability to
combine humor, tragedy, color, freedom, pain, and
beauty, and I'm always trying to do the same thing
myself..
For news its TV, the Sun, and the New York Times. The
Sun is only for scores, movies, and murder news; the Times
is for real news, sorry, Globe. I would pick up the Province
forthe Far Side and the "Smile ofthe Day" but there gets
to be too many papers to throw away.
For poetry, it s the Ginsberg greats of the fifties,
Howl, Kaddisn, and Reality Sandwiches, and Ferling-
hetti's Coney Island of the Mind.
Last and least, I recently picked up a bunch of magazines at a great little store in New York called See/Hear f59
E. 7th, 10003). Idon'tknow what they call the genre, maybe
"Magazine Noir" or "Negative Fascination," but they are
represented by such titles as Answer Me, Bad Seed, Gore
Gazette, Murder Can Be Fun, Smut Peddler, Ungawa, and
Panty Line Fever. Their interests seem to lie in many dark
tilings like B movies, trashy magazines and paperbacks ofthe
fifties and sixties, S and M, dead people and murderers,
especially murderers, and especially mass murderers. The big
favorite seems to be Ed Gcin, closely followed by Charles
Starkweather and Richard Speck, nicy arc really, really
negative, and kind of fun. Together with a pack of mass
murderer trading cards, they make quite a package.
Other titan lhat, I don't mess much with magazines,
except TheBett\Pai>esimd The Betty Pages Anniuil. And 1 met
Paula Klaw.

Kurt Kendall: We got together in 1982,
but we didn't actually become Girl Trouble until 1984.
Did you know tonight you guys are
competing against DOA's reunion

Kahuna: Well, we played al this place
called the Boxing Club in Seattle It was
kind of a benefit type show. There were a
lot of bands, like five bands on the bill.
Beat Happening was one of Ihem. Action
Buddie was playing. Anyway, we always
come up with some sort of gimmick for
our shows, like Go Go Grannie was one of
ihem Things have to be cheap, loo, something we can get a hold of easily, something we can buy. So we decided," let's go
out and buy a bunch of pillows and pass
Ihem out at the show and have a big pillow
fight!"
Dale: We had a big hat Tight, too.
Bon: It worked pretty well
Kurt And wigs, too. We threw out wigs.
There is some potential for violence at
something Ihe that, isn't there?
Kurt You've got lo tiusteverybcdy, youknow.

c have to go through the same
le that Girl Trouble did?
Kurt: No, he didn't.
Kahuna: We were wailing in line being
hassled, and then he came in. He was
really small. He was a really tiny lillle
guy. He came by and then he went ouL
Bon: And he was not hassled! Not hassled
at all!
Kurt When we gol there, there were all
these, like, obvious sound engineers in all
these Morrissey l-shirts, so we thought,
hmmm. And then they left, bul I didn't
know the guy would have lo come in, and
then all of a sudden, the guy comes in with
the guilar player!
Do they have much allegiance tn thcTaco-
Bon: They moved to Seattle
Kurt I would say the only olher actual Tacoma
band that's slill in Tacoma is My Name.

Struggle 7"	 BY MINDY
ABRAMOWITZ
Perhaps to some the name Atomic 61 brings to mind
periodic tables and early Cold War explosives, but try not
to confuse the four members of the band with nuclear
physicists. Their name is actually deriven from a 1961
dual port carburetor—"a neato souped-up carburetor." If
ever there were an invitation to launch into comparisons
between the powerful rumble of a well-tuned machine
and its analogues in the world of bass....
But Atomic 61 tries not to model themselves after
cheap cliches. Take Seattle, for example. For a while,
Todd, Trevor, Phil and Brendan called the Supersonic City
their home. Yet, they describe themselves as firm believers in regular haircuts and other conventional forms of
personal hygiene; their capacity for alcohol consumption
also falls considerably short of records held by incoherent
members of the Seattle musical canon.
"We don't really associate ourselves with the stuff
the media makes Seattle famous for," says Trevor. "We
like to play live, that's our
thing. We don't play that much
in Seattle because we don't
really enjoy playing Seattle
clubs."
"Everyone around there
doesn't like us 'cause we're
way too loud," Todd adds.
Indeed, they are loud and
have since relocated, at
least temporarily, to Portland.
In the past, Atomic 61
has linked themselves with
the likes of Cop Shoot Cop,
Steel Pole Bathtub (the guy
makes his guitar whinny like
a horse!), and other adherents to the noise-mongering
tradition. December 1991 they
appeared in Vancouver, atthe
Cruel Elephant, with Steel
Pole Bathtub as part of a short
tour. At the time their line-up
consisted of Todd Morey and
Trevor Lutzen hiser, the fou nd-
ing members, Lisa Smith, of
former Dickless glory, and
Elizabeth Davis who later
played with 7 Year Bitch. They
went on to record a 7" entitled
"Rip" for Sympathy for the
Record Industry and the 10",
Heartworm, on Box Dog
Sound with Elizabeth and
Lisa.
The two women left the
band shortly thereafter "on
mutual terms" to follow their
own musical instincts. Todd
and Trevor scoured Seattle
for musicians of serviceable
ability until, finally, they struck
upon their current bassist and
drummer. Phil, the drummer,
comes from Portland, while
they had to import Brendan
from Salt Lake City.
"In the end, we never
did find anyone in Seattle
who could play their instruments."
Since the addition of Phil
and Brendan, Atomic 61 has
been on a roll. This past sum-
merthey embarked on a 100-
day-long tour of the States
during whichthey played approximately 80 to 85 shows
and visited almost every
major American city and
some minor ones as well. I
can only wonder about the
kind of reception they got in
Normal, Illinois. Todd does all of the
graphic art on Atomic 61 paraphernalia. At one point he made
a poster in which a puppy and a
kitten are pictured together with
the heading "Buster and Tiffany
couldn't wait to see Atomic 61."
A second photo of the two animals corresponds to the dry
caption, "Now they are dead."
An earnest passer-by was
moved to write "Why does
Atomic61 have to trivialize everything?" on one of them. Before leaving on tour, in an at-^?
tempt to elicit further reaction!?'
Todd expanded his artistic horizons into the realm of graffiti.
"Yeah. I just cut a stefici!
for the first time for spray p<§nt.
There's gonna be Atomic'IfS-l
graffitti all around Seattle nqw.
We've done posters and stickers, now we're graduating tdij.
paint to do some serious vandalism."
But the heady commotion
doesn't stop there. Just prior to
leaving for their tour the band
entertained an offerfrom a German record label to record a
full-length CD for release in Europe and domestically. Upon
returning home, Atomic 61 immediately initiated phase two
of their bo mbardmentthey held
a record release party in Olympia for their yuletide 7" "White
Christmas'TBlue Christmas"
(Sympathy for the Record Industry) at the beginning of December. In January,
Beechwood Music Ltd. will is
sue its British compilation of
American independent bands
on which Atomic 61 will be featured among other such misfit
luminaries as The Jon Spencer
Blues Explosion, Mudwimmin,
Mule and Royal Trux. The CD,
entitled The End of the Road,
will include the song "Rip" from
the band's 7" from April of 1992.

\\r f?/_c ) <e writers switch
pseudonyma'They're prolific
and will make their music available by whatever means are
necessary, hence their scattered discography.
"We've got scads and
scads of new material. Everything we've already released is
getting really stale to us. To a
lot of audiences it's still new,
but to us it's just getting old. We
haven't really gotten a big
enough slice of anything to stick
with one label. Our attitude is
that we have a ton of music that
we like, the more that gets out
there, the better. And maybe
someone will buy it and like it,
so for that we just keep touring
forever. Then none of us will
have to go get jobs cause that's
whatwe'rereally interested in."
In fact, only one member
of Atomic 61 works. Both Todd
and Trevor have been devoting
their energies to the band on a
full-time basis since Christmas
1991. While Todd does the
graphics, Trevor works at setting up shows. He organized
the tour and booked most of
their gigs. Along the way Atomic
|61 has managed to deal with a
Variety of interesting personalities. Jeff Smith, who runs Box
Ifog Sound (on which
Seatworm was released), is a
jriend of theirs and might also
?be known by some as Jo Smitty:
he played in Mr. Epp and the
Calculations in the early eighties. Since then he's been doing
work with video and magazine
and a few months ago put out a
warmly received Melvins video.
Another of their benefactors/producers is the owner of
Sympathy for the Record Industry. After hearing Atomic 61
in San Francisco and liking them
he established correspondence
with the band and maintained it
until they recorded a 7" for him.
Simple as that.
Even the origins of Atomic
61 reflect the ease with which
they move from one project to
the next: "About two years ago
we got an offer from New York
to put out some vinyl for a band
that we were in four years ago.
We just decided that we wanted
to do it enough again to do
something better, so we started
trying to form Atomic 61. We
had the pleasure of working
with Steel Pole Bathtub in San
Francisco. They helped us by
loaning us their rhythm section
for a single in New York. It took
us a while, but after a bit we
started playing with Lisa and
Elizabeth. We started to have a
little bit of success doing what
we wanted to do, instead of just
looking for people who could
play their instruments."
Their "coming-out" effort
as Atomic 61 was a little-known
7" on Baylor Records in New
York. Nevertheless, it re-introduced them to the world of
bands and record labels and
provided them with the means
to continue their development
as a band.
"The piece of vinyl itself
sounds like total shit. We
weren't very happy with that,
but it was the first thing that we
had put out on vinyl. It was a
start. The graphics
turned out neato."
To date, Heartworm
stands out as the culmination of
Atomic 61's recorded work. It
consists of six songs interspersed with hilarious clips
culled from extensive television
and video viewing. The song
"Haywire,"for example, is sandwiched between selectionsfrom
ATOMIC 61
a porn show with a message. A
woman sighs, "They tried to
give me the real love that I
needed, but I knew deep down
inside that they really wanted
me sexually. So, they couldn't
give me the real love that I
wanted. I want you to love me
— David and Greg." Next thing
you know you're listening to a
visceral tribute to lust. Just as
the song winds down, the
woman pipes up again: "Of
course we'll do it, honey, and
you can stay here. It's better to
have love based on sexual attraction than no love at all."
Another song begins with
a plea from a televangelist for
anyone in need of a Bible to
simply call him and confess.
The fast-paced song that follows chronicles a woman's es-
capefrom an abusive boyfriend:
fleeing to Wall Drug and contemplating her fate in a local
restaurant.
While their lyrics and music reflect some serious existential angst, Atomic 61 likes to
juxtapose the intensity of their
songs with "perfect non-
sequitors" that bear testimony
to "the spastic world" that they
perceive. Do they worry about
being misunderstood and taken
too seriously? Yup.
"I think people think that
we're really serious a lot of
times. They take what we say
on their own terms — in terms
of themselves. They think that
all this stuff is totally deathly
serious. It fucks their lives up
and they've got to sit down with
their moms, or something, and
talk really seriously about it. We
walk around the world and all
these people are freaked out
inside their own heads and we
don't know what the hell they're
doing or why they're doing it.
The only thing we feel we can
do in our music is express that
and how we feel about it. Most
of it really cracks us up. We
want to inject a little bit of humour into things — Heartworm
is little more on the light side.
The one thing that people
can't handle about us is that
when we're playing music really hard, or when I'm screaming my head off about something, we're being really serious. All the stuff that I sing
about in my lyrics... I'm totally,
deathly, ice-cold serious. A lot
of people don't like that just
because it's hard for them to
handle. Atthe same time, we're
having a goodtime being alive
in the world. One ofthe reasons
that people associate us with
the hardcore movement is that
we do feel very strongly. That's
not necessarily something you
find in pop music or regular
rock. It's particular to hardcore
—or atleast itwas. Beforethat,
it was coming out of the stuff
that was being recorded and
performed in the late sixties."
Live, Atomic 61, and especially Todd, have an intense
Rollinsesque presence. From
the bare-chested, tatooed,
shorts-clad look to the bulging
veins and flying sweat, they've
got the Angry-Young-Men-With-
A-Lesson-About-Self-Esteem
style down pat. Songs about suicide, the urgency of life, conformity and other related themes confirm their allegiance to the didactic hardcore crusade. Clean living and agood attitude are what
it's all about.
Many may recali the
memorable show last December at which Atomic 61 and Steel
Pole Bathtub wowed the usually
staid audience at the Cruel Elephant. This past summer they
werescheduled to return to Vancouver to headline at the Elephant, but the recent changes
in border-crossing procedures
forced them to cancel. The closest they could come was Bellingham. Some of you may remember going to watch them in
July only to discover that little
fact. Unfortunately, they neglected to inform the management at the Cruel Elephant.

. cruet elephant /< Optimism. Blatent optimism. So
much optimism I almost had a fit.
But Optimism is what Happy Man
exerts. But believe it or not, the
name of the band has nothing to do
with the attitude. After all, why would
a band want to name itself after a
superhero thateveryone, good and
evil, would want to kick the teeth
of? "A name's a name, it doesn't
mean anything," says singer Graham Brown. "I mean, does the name
Police mean anything?"
Too true, who would wanna
buy something made by cops when
stuff that's pumped out by drug-
pushers and cop-killers is way more
cool? "And look at the Beatles,"
adds drummer Mark Gruft, "dumb
name, great band. What matters is
the talent obviously."
Happy Man is four guys: Graham Brown (guitar and vocals),
Jay Homenchik(ditto), Mark Gibbs
(bass and vocals) and Mark Gtuft
(aforementioned drummer). These
four guys are totally independent:
their record company, Stomp, is
Jay and Graham's alone; everything is done by them and close
friends including the graphics on
their CD, Born to Entertain ; their
upcoming video is done by more
close friends; and all their finances,
like mosl other indie bands, comes
out of their own wallets. There's no
feeling of stress or resentment
"However, I would like to throw my
boss out of the window," Jay says
with a reflective smile.
The usual dumb question of
any deep messages lurking in their
music was responded to pretty
quickly with "Well, yeah, whattya
think?" answers. "If you read the
lyrics (he didn't say "dummy" although I could sense he might)
they're pretty socially conscious
and provoking" says Graham. The
problem is, you don't expect a band
with the trite name of Happy Man
to invoke social consciousness. You
kinda expect songs about getting
drunk, sunny days, and well... getting drunk.
Jay, the cofounder of the
group, met Graham after returning
from England wherein a series of
previously formed bands, including Brilliant Orange, had broken
up. Through a mutual acquaintance,
they met eye to eye at that charming bastion of British Imperialism
and terminally shitty wallpaper, the
Rose and Thorn, aka the RaT. "I
liked Jay, we got along great immediately. However, I must add, I
liked his girlfriend even more." Jay
replied to this with a grunt. I tried
to press the issue to get more of a
less-subdued reaction, but they
didn't feel like talking about it. After the initial meeting, (hey heard
about a bass guitarist and a drummer both named Mark (no relation), someone came up with the
droll name of Happy Man, and a
new local indie band was created
out of the froth of the beer taps at
the RaT.
Another way Happy Man was
created, according to an extremely
profound outburst of artistic license
by Graham, was "O.K., you have an
intersection, four ways, and you
have four cars heading for it at the
same time. In one car in one lane
you have Jimi Hendrix. The second
car is driven by Bob Dylan. The
third car contains Lou Reed. The
fourth is being driven by B.B. King.
They all collide in the middle and
what comes out is Happy Man."
Yes, when I form a band I'm going
to compare it to wreckage of a
four-car pile-up. Hopefully, thesheer
destruction of such a spectacle will
force people to slowdown and take
appreciation.
The music itself is light and
toe-tappingly pop-like, considering the type of music Graham is
into. "Facepuller. Facepuller'sgood.
I went to a Lou Reed concert and it
brought tears to my girlfriend's
eyes." I added that I once saw another local indie band, Shine, wear
Happy Man t-shirts. "Oh? Shine's
good! Shine!" Regarding theirown
music, "It's good music," explains
Graham, "my mother liked it. Out of
all the bands I've been in, my mother
likes this one." (I can imagine one
of the quotations on a future album, "Graham's mom liked this
one.")
We all had difficulty in actually labelling the brand of music
they play, was it alternative? "Alternative to what?" said Mark the
drummer. Graham emphasizes, "It's
good music. We're a good band,
that's all there is to it." But do they
fit intoadefinitive Vancouver sound?
"There's no such thing," says Jay,
the obvious ones. "When's the
last time CiTR played U2?" asked
Jay. "1982?" Actually, it was
probably 1984 but I really don't
know so I really had difficulties
arguing the point.
However, that friction didn't
last long. It's been said (in
Discorder) that Graham and Jay
are two of the best singers in
Vancouver, or something along
those lines. I was pretty surprised
to find out that they thought it
was silly. "I was kind of
dissapointed because the saxophone wasn't mentioned", added
Graham. It was cool to find out
that they didn't have inflated egos.
I really didn't feel like interviewing a bunch of jerks that evening
and I didn't.
Happy Man and I somehow
started to talk about commercialized , big-time, mainstream,
multi-million dollar, white-slave
trading, Lee lacocca namebrand
music. "There's a big difference
between marketing yourself as
an image and being an actual
performer," says Jay.
"For example Madonna is
a great seller of herself [and how]
But lets not mention her singing
and music," says Mark. "In big
business, controversy sells, just
served some slagging (Actually, I
was kinda disappointed about that).
One of the weirdest things that I
noticed when talking to these guys
is that, well...they're normal.
There's no raving psycho thing
like 0 from Olivelawn and there's
no drug problem (or so I'm told).
Happy Man is just a bunch of guys
who enjoy what they do, play good
music, entertain crowds, and do
their own thing at their own expense. What more could any band
ask for? (O.K., the bazillion dollars, the cars, the harems, etc.
etc..)
But even without massive
coinage, Happy Man seems to be
perpetually uplifting in attitude, if
not lyrics. They got that tyoe of
sound that goes great in a local
venue and come January, they go
on a tour of this great country of
The band is not even close
to being a year old so when I
asked if anything that constituted
as a dilemna or problem of any
shape or size occured, I was out
of luck. They're just too young.
The most recent thing that quali-
"it's all the same six chords." "It's
the same in Seattle," adds Graham, "there's no definite city
sound. There's plenty of other
types of music aside from cheetah."
Happy Man is one of the
luckier local bands because they
get a lot of air play from Coast
1040, probably attributable to their
pop-sound. "Like I said before,
it's good music. It's not guitar
thrash or blues, but," he also adds,
"ifyou want us to rip your face off
orgetyou really mellow, we will."
(Somehow, I just don't expect a
band with the moniker of Happy
Man to do a Helmet cover.) Still,
some of the band's popularity is
beyond anyone's understanding
(Canadian Content rules). "I have
no idea why 1040 is playing our
music." says Jay. "Maybe they
like us?"
"We owe a lot to college
radio," says Jay, "but it's kinda
hypocritical." With this Graham
and Mark the drummer took the
offensive (unfortunately, against
me, an eager young elementary-
heart cheated space cadet): "We
understand you [college radio]
play bands that need to be exposed, but what happens when
they've made it?" asked Mark.
They pointed out examples like
look at Sinead O'Connor." (Although, I'm still not too sure ripping up a picture of Pope John
Paul II, the symbol of Roman
Catholicism and Medieval ideology, in New York City exactly
helped her image as an Irish
singer.)
"I listen to Joni Mitchell,"
says Graham, as a much needed
pause in this quagmire of money
and the damnation of souls to
the god of greed. "Cult status is
cool," says Graham [cult as in
norm, not as in the band]. I asked
who the band like as cult followers, like how about the destitute
of Granville Mall? "Are you kidding? They dress better than me!
If I offered $20 for one of their
leather jackets, I'd probably get
a refusal."
Somehow, I don't think
they're even the right crowd for
Happy Man. Happy Man don't
talk about how big they want to
become, but it's assumed that
the leviathan size of Bryan Adams
is too big. "Although, you can't
knock his back-up band, they
really know how to rock," says
Jay. What about Adams himself?
"Grunt."
Despite these obvious ones,
Happy Man didn't slag other
bands, even the ones I felt de-
thei
ponderance of "which one of those
buttons on the pop-dispensing
machine gives out Miller High-
Lite? It ate my change." [In reference to Mel. CiTR's/Discorder's
beer machine] Profound, utterly
profound. Anyway, even if something bad did happen, they probably didn't tell me 'cuz, well, it's
really none of my business.
With Happy Man, catch-all
phrases like "peace" and "love" were
being sported around, so it's really
hard to be critical about a band like
this. Sappy? No, just realistic. You
can't go through life thinking unhappy thoughts and thinking there's
no hope. If that's the case you might
as well take a swan dive off of the
Granville St. Bridge (helluva postcard, there!). "There's no point in
getting depressed abouteverything.
You just gotta stay above all that"
says Graham. It's nice to hear a
band that believes life isn't totally
shit and yet refer to what they perceive as problems that we all face
with their music. They just can't
offend anyone.
Their CD, Born to Entertain, is
good: its sound isn't heavy and yet
the messages are there. It's kinda
difficult to explain, it's...enjoyable.
Although I can't really hear what
that intersection analogy has to do
with it. If I were to draw an opinion
(and my opinions should never be
taken too seriously) I'd compare
them to other up and comers,
Memory Day and definitely Shine.
In summary, the band with
the mildly-amusing name is simply
that, a band with a mildly amusing
name. The name does say it all,
despite their protests. If you ever
feel like mellowing out after destroying your eardrums from listening to your average thrash-gui-
tar-mosh-til-you-puke grit from
Caseatic [the name Republican-
Washington, D.C. has given the area
from Vancouver, B.C. to Portland,
Oregon, and I don't care but I don't
wanna be in the same regional label
as Billy Kwan of Almost Live: You
know "Mind your manners?"], just
listen to Happy Man and veg.

For those readers unfamiliar
with these two it's somewhat of an
understatement to say both have
been very productive members of
the hardcore scene. Personally, I've
been listening to Dave

Boston,inthecarly'80's. Through
the years I followed his path and
continued listening when he sang

has left me slightly more pushy

will ride mood and impart upon

in movie making for this pasl
year.
Since some of you wouldn 't

Last month I promised you faithful peons that this newsprint would
be slathered in the spit of a famous director, namely Spike
"Malcolm X" Lee, and though 1
have been known to lie, cheat
and steal, in this case I'm as
clean as only a slightly greying
I was traipsing about in
that semi-dream world which I
inhabit and I found myself smack
dab in the middle of a weird and
mystical place. There were many
people of African-American descent floating around. They were
very earnestly trying to make a
scope and attempted to tell the
life story of a man, Malcolm X,
who held great significance for
them. The small guy in charge of
the whole production was constantly moving. Questions were
flying, people were shouting, and
wagging their fingers and clutching their back pockets.
A tall man approached
mc. I recognized the figure as
academy award-winning actor,
Dcnzcl Washington. "He was in
scarchofthctruth,"Denzcl wailed
at mc, "Malcolm's life is ...evolution. I'm not Malcolm X,there's
no way I can be! The same god,
the same spirit that moved
Malcolm X can move mc. If I
can...illustrate the evolution of
the man, then I'm thankful."
"Dcnzel," I implored,"!
need to speak to Spike Lee! I
made a promise."
Following his advice, I
went to speak to the two observing women sitting just outside
the action. They were quiet, composed, and happy to watch the
proceedings. Behind them, on
the street, marched youths. Some
were very interested in the movie,
while others were oblivious to
the filming, but all wore uniforms decorated with large X's.
I asked the women, whose
nametags read WIFE - Betty and
DAUGHTER - Attallah respectively, what they thought ofthe
"I think a lot of people
are learning about Malcolm,"
Betty quickly responded. "A lot
of people felt proud to connect
with his spirituality to make statements or to gain strength. I'm
pleased when I see someone with
a picture of my husband. I'm
pleased when I see a hat, a t-
shirt, a jacket. What it says to me
is, 'He's alive'.
Wealwayspayhommage
to our ancestors. We always tai k
about them. Someone said thai if
e call tl
day, they never tlie.
lineage. Thai is ho'
Malcolm alive."
Attallah answered more
slowly. "It's different for me to
read and study Malcolm X. I
think at this point, as an adull, 1
need to explore different people's
interpretations."
They told me I would
find Spikeifl went to the front of
the parade. Sure enough, there
he was, speaking to the young
people, asking them to gel their
parents to take the day off work

he whom I was bonded to d

Quolh he, "Marketing!"
"Speak  whal  is  in  yo
heart," I begged him.
Quoth he, "We have tola
responsibility to pass down tl
history to our children. If we <
not tell our children who Jack
Robinson, who Malcolm X, wl
Dr. King was...it has lo be mo
than, 'Well, Malcolm X said,"I
; necessary.'" It has

Then, he waved his hand
and the youths marched on, right
over the top of my freckle-faced
head. When I came to I was face
down on my typewriter with my
drool, a few magazines, and a
copy of "Canadian Audio Electronic Press Kit - Malcolm X" as

devised two sets of kudos. "H"
denotes my choice in the sphere
of Hollywood enterprises and "I"
indicates my fave in the independent realm.
Starting with the real power
in any cinematic venture, I'll bow
to his demands and elect Spike
Lee as best director of 1992 (II).
Though Malcolm X has been gel-
ting a more tepid response than
initially expected, Lee's work
certainly cannol be faulted, lie
promised grandiose and gratuli
ose he delivered: a full throe hours
through lime, space, and a human psyche. Though I didn't
choose Denzel Washington in the
acting category he was my sec-
interesting, intelligent film.
Though his film was only
lacked Ihc kind of pretension that
makes a Spike Lee film work,
Christopher Munch also earns
my pick for best director (I). His
film, The Hours and 'limes dealt
with famous people, too, though
on a fictionalized level. Speculating whal might have happened
on a 1963 Spanish vacation taken
iiteil homosexual manager. Brian
Lpstien. Munch \'l he Hours and
Times is a sludy in gentle, restrained film making.
Also from The Hours and
Times, David Angus gave the
besl performance by a lead aclor
(I) this year. I lis sensitive portrayal of the unrequited Brian
:.pstien is not only the best thing
I've
this y
matches any acting I 'veever seen
in an independent production. The
Hours and Times has only been
er (al
thei 992 Vancoi
Film Feslival) and doesn't quile
meet ihe running lime of a regular feature length film. If it docs
of regular run, be sure not to
miss it. You needn 'l be a Beatles
fan or even know who these characters are to enjoy this small,
beautiful film.
Another small, and beautifully grim, film was released this
year, though lo much more fan
fare and media discussion.
Glengarry Glen Ross is a claustrophobic gem that features the
talents of Jack Lemmon and Al
Pacino, my tied choices for best
actor (II). I've never really liked
Lemmon (especially in such fare
as Dad) but here he shows his
mettle as Shelley "The Machine"
Levine, a winner salesman who's
come down with a chronic case
of loser. Lemmon's subtle range
could only come with maturity
and practice.
Pacino, the jester's version
of Robert deNiro, is hisinsinuat-
ingly charming self as Ricky
Roma, the ace ofthe salesroom.
Only Pacino can say "fuck" more
than three times in a sentence
and still come across as refined,
(for you sensitive souls out there,
the biggest shocker in Glengarry
Glen Rossis Jack Lemmon's verbalization of that oft-heard F-
commenced expletive.)
One of the main reasons
Pacino and Lemmon where my
picks for the acting department
was not just the performances
but the drive ofthe words them-
with writing like David Mamct's
they are able to sing. Mamct is
regarded as one of the shining
lights of playwriting. With
Glengarry Glen Ross, he turns
his beam full on Hollywood as
well.
Hal Hartley is sometimes,
rather condescendingly, called
the "critics darling" ofthe independent scene. If he's trying to
lose that reputation, my earmarking him as best writer (I) for
1992 is not going to help matters. His Simple Men had mc
choki ng on my popcorn mid spew-
ing diet Coke through my nose,
Inaconversationlhadwith
another independent director,
Gregg Araki, he intimated that
Hartley's work wasn't edgy
enough. However, Araki's film.
The Living End, a highly controversial shoot 'em up road
movie with a substandard script,
is my biggest indie disappointment of 1992. My advice to
Hartley (humble as it is) would
be to stay his course and leave
the edge, and bad writing, to
On the subject of bad movies, Honeymoon in Vegas takes
the garlic cake for stinkiest
project of 1992. This little cha-

Gas,Food,Lodging. FairuzaBalk,
Vancouver native, is my choice
for best actress (I) for her work
as the impressionable, single-
parenlcd teen growi ng up i n Goi ng
Nowhcrcsville, U.S.A. Billed by
my admiring friends as "the nexl
Winona Ryder", young Balk
shows in Gas, Food, Lodging
that her talent already outstrips
that of her older peer.
"Outstrips" is putting
things mildly. Ryder, and her
partner in trendiness, Keanu
Reeves, earn the worst perfor-
the head for their film-wrecking performances in Dracula.
I, alone in Vancouver it seems,
enjoyed the movie as a whole.
If only ability, instead of box-
office draw, had been a casting
consideration, Dracula would
have lived up lo its hype and
potential. If Ryder and Reeves
are enjoying their careers they
had better stick to contemporary settings  for their future
Back on the plus side, the
setling jumping, ability stretching Judy Davis is my choice for
best actress of 1992 (II). Davis

of this year was t
in  The  Player

My favorite independent
film of 1992 is The Player's polar
opposite. Julie Dash's Daughters
can get from the glitz and glamour
of Hollywood. Sel on an off-shore
Carolina island at the turn of the
century, Daughters of the Dust
tells the pasl, present, and future
story of a former slave family. A
triumph of experimental cinematography and narrative, this film
more than any olher this year made

1610  Robson Street,   Robson  Public  Market (upstairs) BY GRANT LAWRENCE
Welcome, readers, to a new year.
Buldon'lgel loo excited, friends... I
mean, really, it's only the mid-early
'90's and nothing new has really
happened. I'm still paying GST on
chocolate bars, the Corporate Ogre
still has an ever tightening stranglehold on ye olde vinyl, and, on a
positive note, I haven't been fired
from this column yet. Even more
positive still, the elements in the 7"
world still seem undaunted if not
fueled by the apparent "vinyl is dead"
threat. Sextillions of 7"'s are still
flowing freely from the pores of
punk rock bands everywhere and
the 7" remains to be the truest form
of what is "independent music."
Right, Sea Monkeys? The
Sea Monkeys, who hail from New
York City, are definitely January's
flavour flav. Totally high energy
shout-punk rock, bustin' at the seams
with youthful exuberance and excitement. The two fairly awesome
songs are titled, quaintly, "Oh No,
I'm Sammy Petrillo" and "Nipsey-
land," mirroring the Sea Monkeys'
apparent and familiar punk fixation
wilh post baby boomer TV pop culture. Fans of groups like Mr. T Ex
perience and Young Fresh Fellows
must indulge. Hey, does anyone
know if ihese guys have an album
out? Maybe I'll write: Vital Music,
81 Second Ave., New York, New
York, 10003, USA.
One of the best things about
music today is that you can get just
about anything you want. Everybody's doing everything. You want
rap? You got it. You want punk?
You got it. You want industrial?
You got it. Same goes for almost
anything from any era anyone can
think of. Minneapolis' Vandalias
take on the '70's mellow, classic
rock thing, add a bit of new sunshine
pop and come out sounding like the
gang from Welcome Back Kolter
singing Teenage Fanclub songs. And
does it work? Yeah, like oil and
water, baby. (Tenpop Works, P.O.
Box 16304, Minneapolis, MN,
55416, USA)
Seattle's Night Kings have
gotta be the closest and newest incarnates lo the Sonics that I' ve heard
since the Mummies' first attack a
few years back. What gives on this
slab is a badly needed overdose of
the usual shit: super-charged fuzz
guitar, machine gun drumming, and
way over-driven scratch vocal styl-
ings. This is very tough, very sloppy
and very amazing rock and roll music. (In The Red, P.O. Box 49593,
Los Angeles, CA, 90049, USA)
You know when rock magazines sometimes give away a promo
7" from some feature band(s) of the
month? And you know how most of
the songs are usually throw-away
outtakes? Doesn't that suck? Unfortunately, such is the case with two
such 7"'s I have recently obtained
from said "rock magazines." The
first is a free-bee disc from ihe world
leaders of hip pulp: Sassy magazine.
They've gotten together with Sub-
Pop to releaseafour band, foursong
EP featuring Codeine, Velocity
Girl, Beat Happening, and Sebadoh. Codeine's song is a dead
paced, SLOW bore; Sebadoh are a
mixed bag of poopy (yes, lhat's
poopy) big rock; and Beat Happening (who are one of my favor
cr)n,
s Ihc m
with a Heather-sung, two-guitar
only, negatively hypnotic plodder.
The winner here is Velocity Girl.
Though I've slagged them in this

lhal gives the term "garage" a nega-

one, What Wave. (What Wave, Issue

In facl, Canada's college radio bible, National Chan, reported that
Eric's Trip were the first band ever
lo lum down an offer from Sub-Pop.
N.C. were wrong in two regards: 1)

turned them down FLAT about a
year and a half ago; and 2) il turns

and it's nice to know there's life on

Brunswick, E14 6K6)
Not lhal it ain't a wild life over
here, too, Nomeansno's "official
side-project," The Hanson Brothers, have jusl released their first
full-length album, and much to my
excitement there was a bonus 7"
included in the 12" rock packet. Let
it be known to non-Hanson Brothers
disciples that the name comes from
the twin bozo hockey players in the
'70's Paul Newman flick Slapshol,
and lhat the band is a Canadian tribute (with a hockey twisl) to the
Ramones. This will therefore explain the first song on the 7", "Blitzkrieg Hops." Yeah, il sounds jusl
like the Ramones, yeah it rocks and
so do the olher iwo boss tunes. Ihc
Hansons have managed to score on
all three here, so I guess that means
a hat-trick, righl.' Please forgive me.
And here comes another all-
new, all-girl assault from down New
York way by TheGloo Girls. Quite
a bit of reverse sexism here, men...
The A-side is a iune called "Yo
Biondie" in which ihe ihrcc gals
shrilly sing, "Yo biondie, you
wouldn't know what to do if we said
'yes'"! I sure know what I'd do!
After slappin' her know-all mug a

like my sex). Not as super as cub or
the Shit Birds, bul it's  up there.

I've mentioned the Mummies
a lot this monlh and, yes, I'm going
lo do it one more time. Mummies
lead-dog, Trent Ruanc, produced ihis
nexl slab o' shit, a single by The
Fingers. As can be fully expected,
it's that lo-fi, lo-talenl, stripped-
down, straight ahead, three chord
punk rock. Greal chop guitar sound
on this bashing record, though the
chords do gel a little repetitive.
Sounds like Supercharger, and that's
a good thing. (Bag Of Hammers,
P.O. Box 928, Seattle, WA, 98111,

this Paw single I'm looking at because "it's ihcnext big ihing.prick!".

what did i think of the show?
it was a rock'n'roll show, man.

token goofball jump on stage and
if you've been paying attention so far, yeah, you 're right, it does
sound like every show you've seen
in the last few years, that's why i feel
"i'm sorry you' re disappointed
but times may change and so did i."

did it. a good job, a professional job,
but a job all the same.
il was like watching a rainbow
thai is all one color.
"all work and no play makes
jack a dull boy."
however, the show did have a
few fine points with the credit being
given to the few long, "heavy and
ethereal" numbers, written and sung
by ihe bass player, david barbe. the
whole band seemed to click together
during these tunes and really pump
oul the sound but it was too few and
far between.
who knows, maybe it was the
end of the tour, or maybe bob's
holding back his ego to give the rest
of the band some air. or maybe
they're trying to get some financial
security or some crazy deal like that.

were this kid, I'd fucking sue these
guys!" to which he received cheers
of approval. "Well, I guess we' re an

as they burst inlo theirnext stream of
songs, stopping not again until their
last song "Dead Love" and ending in
a culmination of feedback and noise
before walking off stage.

drum techs scurry around on slage
for half an hour, the lights went
down, the smoke machine came on,
and Mudhoney came oul and shook
theplace. Playing mostly oldies like
"You Got It," "This Gift" and "If I

some of the newer tunes like "Inlo

There's nothing thai can ruin a show
e effectively than a few fuckin'
idiots whose egos demand the attention of those around them. They
howl, whistle, yell and throw fireworks around so they can feel a part
of the show. For example, when
Mike Muir (Suicidal Tendencies
vocalist) was doing his self-righteous speech on mind revolution,
there was a build-up to some line
thai only the people immediately in
front of ihe stage could hear because, for some inexplicable reason,
some people started howling lhat
redneck howl that reminds me of
Dukes of Hazard reruns and sucked
almost everyone around me inlo il.
From whal I could piece together, the Suicidals were iheir usual
energetic selves. It would have been
greal to hear some of their earlier
when they'll realize that trying to
bring a punk attitude for heavy metal
consumption is an effort bound lo
fail.

Yearout
Yearout talks to ihe "Now" genera-
1 ne high moments are many
on ihis release, so I'U only mention
a few of the mosl stellar iracks. The
firsl keeper, "Sweet Be Jesus," is a
classic and unrelenting statement
on blind faith in organized religion.
In ihc span of four minutes Lung
call down every major religous
figure of the lasl 2000 years and
them all into the court of
Lung to render judgement for their
crimes against humanity. While the
twin-barrelled guilars tear off
cyberpunk riffery like a lisl of
charges, the bass suddenly pounds
back with a throbbing verdict, which
you know is guilty. Like a judge
presiding over the proceedings, the
flail—you can almost see the
the arms and drumsticks flying,
culling ihrough the air as if they
wished lo knock ihe angels from
their all-loo- safeand bleached white
heaven, down lo the earth so that
they might know that there is a new
judge, a new jury. That is to say,
there is Lung.
Just as compelling ,s the
anthem "Pat Hogue Must Die." On
the surface, il would seem lo be a
scathing personal attack, but lhat is
where you fail forthe trap lhat Lung
has set. On further observation, we
see the character of Pat Hogue as the
every man should hope for: security,
independence, freedom. However,
ii is not Lung lhat is sentencing him to
death, ii is a government whose
business interests perpetuate growing
unemployment; a government thai
does not care if its citizens don't have
a clean place tolivc; a government that
can't understand why everyone isn't
as rich as they are. In this sense it is
clear whal Lung is saying: that Pal
I logue musl not die, for if he dies our
freedom and our future dies wilh him.
Of course this will probably be
misunderstood, and like Springsteen' s
"Bom in the USA" and Nirvana's
"Teen Spirit," it will probably become
an anthem for the very people it wishes
k. What,.
•rlheca
be denied thai they have created a
prolesl anthem as subliuieK chilling
as Dylan's "Ihe Lonesome Death of
Hattie Carroll."
In essence, a stunning peicc of
controlled fury that never loses sight
of its goals: lo educate, to question,
to rock, and to roll.

CiTR's offices, along with a note
on who you are (so the whole
world can know that you'd own
something like that), and I'll see
it gets a mention in this very
column!!!!!! Also, I have just
had a pile of totally wacko vinyl
sent in from my old place, so
watch out, there's lot's more to
come!!! And don't forget to get
the aforementioned sampler
(plug, plug, plug)!
lead singer Pete Campbell's moronic
between-song banler. Without
exception Pete has managed to turn
everyone completely off with his
snide and self-righteous remarks.
This is indeed not cool, not is it
punk, it's stupid.
Campbell has personally
insulted me and this magazine, as
well as Shadowy Men On A
Shadowy Planet and the Reverend
Horton Heat. He has even gone so
far as to insult bands he does not
even know, like the Dharma Bums.
So why, you ask, if I have so much
contempt for this stage-jerk, am I
reviewing his band's debut album?
I'm doing it to: a) support local
talent; b) 1 actually think ihey are
talented; and c) maybe Pete will
shut his fucking trap after reading
this. Stick to singing Peter, a
comedian you are not.
All of thai shil aside, The
Sweaters have actually managed to
come up with a nicely packaged,
well-rounded and fairly rockin' CD
here. With 13 songs in total, the
album's title indefinitely comes into
play being lhat most of the tunes are
certainly POP songs. Pop-punk in
fact. Buzzzcocky pop-punk.
Modemette/Buzzcocky pop-punk-
chop., .you get Iheidea. Though there
is definitely some filler ("Kurt Got
Hurt," a sappy ode to Fastback/
Young Fresh Fellow Kurt Bloch is
pretty embarrassing), the catchy
"hits" stand out, making this an
album worth someyourattention. Il
isn't incredible or anything, but il
ain'l all lhal bad neither.

Who's ready to get high!? I sure am,
cuz I'm stoked on this new EP by the
Has
;rd  Son
of Fu
Rock'n'Roll. Rick "The Man"Sim
bassist  Doug  Evans  and ne
Rav
(Ex-
Scratch Acid and one time TAD
can-kicker) hop in iheir carriage
and ride, peeling oul on the "Dirt
Country Road," hugging the curves
while they "Rock the Nation"
(Velvet Monkeys, eat dust!), and
leave ya' chokin' on the fumes
with "Sugarfox." Didjits—five
albums strong on super-charged
guilar devastation and thanking
everyone for their support, lhat
includes you, mother-fucker.

EXPLOSION
Crypt-style!
(Crypt Records)
Budget rock is in. When I say budget
rock, I mean stripped-down,
minimalistic twang, plod and crash
(guilar, bass + drums for you non-
hip types). When [ hear budget rock,
I hear groups like ihe Mummies, the
Gories, the Cheater Slicks... and the
Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.
Imagine Willie Dixon and Hasil
Atkins getting into fisticuffs and the
referees are three scruffy-lookin'
lads who use their favorite volume
of "Desperate Rock'n'Roll" for
scorecards.
Gctthepicture?No?Wellthen
listen lo Crypt-style for heavy doses
of harp-wailin',guitar-wranghn'and
drum-smashin' in songs like the title
cut, "Lovin' Up a Storm,"
"Walermain," "Twcntynine," and
the tribute lo Wisconsin, "Yolb
Block of Cheese" to catch my drift.
Did I mention budget rock is in?
Thank you.

You might have noticed the
occasional foray inlo hve funk of
the cut type in the late '80's and the
early '90's by the likes of the acid

the British Isles, and the creeping i

New Havies' Heavy Rhyme
Experience Vol. I But don'l you
wonder why this stuff is coming
back? Of cou rse you do. Il' s' because
a lot of musiczoids into tha funk gol
tired of being amazed by whal James
Brown was doing in the '60's and
' 70' s, and instead of trying lo jam it
into their electronic circuitry, only
lo have il come out funked up,
actually picked up an instrument
and tried lo do il for real. Ihen they
really, really becameamazed at whal
James Brown was doing back ihen.
Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley
and Pee Wee Ellis, better known as
the Homy Homs, have been in the
Molherships of George Clinton and
James Brown since the mid '60's,
hopping back and forth between the
dual pillars of funk for at lcasl 15
years, all the while lending some of
the besl bounce-lo-lhe-ounce brass
to both. Well, aboul a year ago, I
intriguing, filling with a potpourri
of musical value. Although they
have lillle to do wilh ihc deep sea,
let alone sediments, I feel it's safe lo
assume they've bathed.
Ihe Stone Temple Pilots seem
to have everything going for them.
Big Canadian music stations arc
frequently airing their nifty lillle
video and theirgeneral sound should
satisfy a variety of tastes; snipits of
Danzig, Alice in Chains and Pearl
inspiration. All the members come
across as strong musicians but the
whole cluster is a tad overpackaged.
In other words, they seem great but
seem is ihe operative word. Ihe
songs are catchy, the pictures arc
distorted, lyrics are iwislcd, bul is
this all some major label
Frankenstein to boost sales? I dunno.

But wait a minulc, whai's this
on Ihe horizon? I know lhat more
and more people arc gcllin' into lha
funk, and I'm aware of each reissued
new, 1992! And tha funk is there in
full force! Of course things ain't
perfect yet, bul Ihis 76minule chunk
of aluminum and plastic has gol to
be the closcsl thing to it since disco
began literally eating up all the
funkatecrs back in 1975. Macco's
got a six-piece band, a 14 minulc
version of "Soul Power," and more
groove lhan the San Andreas fault-
line! Now that the originators have
shown everybody that ilean bedone
in the 90's, I think a few years from
now things arc gonna be lookin'
mighty fine once again. Funk, Part
II, begins here.
