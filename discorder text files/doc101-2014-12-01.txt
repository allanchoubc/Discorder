REC CENTRE - PG.14 .     -
A band bridging the gap between crunchy sci-fi
sounds and indie dance pop, Rec Centre are ready
to take you on a whimsical journey. Discorder
talks to frontman (and only member) Alex Hudson
about rhythm, growing older, creating music, and
his latest album Monster of the Week.
IF YOU  DON'T  HAVE   MONEY,  GET  MONEY  -
pg.22     j|\ |   f    ; ,   '
The presence of Vancouver's art spaces, both
emerging and established, is small by condo standards. What is the cause of this ongoing cultural
battle between property developers and artist
centres? Is it that the city isn't supporting the arts
or that people in the arts just aren't trying hard
enough?

SUB Blvd., Vancouver, B.C., V6T1Z1, Canada. EDITOR'S NOTE
SAY MY PSEUDONYM
Illustrations by Rachel Lin
The music world is full of pseudonyms.
Writers attribute bylines to pen names, musicians adopt other aliases or stage names,
and even music fans themselves take on a
self-assigned username when commenting
online. It can seem like a muddled mess of
monikers — and it can add a level of frustration when you're trying to keep authenticity
and still honour peoples' wishes to remain
anonymous — but in my time at Discorder,
I've come to better understand the motivations behind this concealment.
My predecessor's bottom line was this: if
Discorder could find a musician's full name
online connected to their band/through other
sources, then we included it in the article. In
this sense, we're not revealing anything that
isn't already widely accessible. When I came
into the position I was eager to uphold the
same standards and thoroughness — even
clashing with one or two groups about publishing their real names after finding them in
other online articles — but the mor6 I've adjusted to the community, the more I digress.
It's not about creating mystique oi* about being a diva or any shit like that; it's increasingly a response to how the Internet is affecting people's lives.
Few artists can support themselves entirely
on music and those who can probably aren't
receiving coverage in an independent, hyper-
local magazine like Discorder. These musicians all have another job —or jobs — and
sometimes those fields can't peacefully coexist. No one should have to decide between
their career and their music and so you take
on a name that will expunge you of (hopefully) most of the risk.
The recent digitization effort of Disorder's entire library is an interesting mirror of
this. In the "80s, when you were reviewing
albums for a campus magazine, you probably weren't thinking that decades down the
line that review would be available online for
anyone with a Wi-Fi connection to browse.
(They wouldn't have been thinking about
the Internet in the first place, but you get the
idea,) Every writer has to start somewhere
EDITOR'S NOTE and the content you created while you were
still mastering a semicolon probably isn't
your best. Thanks to this whole Internet business, your progression and early blunders
have a web address to them.
A regular contributor for Discorder recently started writing under a fake name.
Do I know why he made the switch? No. I
contemplated taking a stand and saying, "No,
anything you write has to have your real
name attached to it," but then you're valuing full disclosure over creativity and a message. There are liability issues that come up
when you don't have a real person attached
to articles being published but the chances of
that nipping a publication like Discorder are
minimal. We're not producing slander and
exposes; we're profiling musicians and writing about bands.
Have I ever donned a pseudonym? Not for
Discorder, but I've embraced anonymity at
other times during my relatively short writing career. I've had to self-censor myself oc-
cassionally, leaving out details or foregoing
saying more than I want to on a topic because
I ask myself, "Will this ever come back to
bite me?" It's unfortunate to think that content has a limitation on it because of potential future repercussions that might not even
manifest but the reality is I have to be careful
about those kinds of things. My goal in life
has always been to work with kids and that
means staying aware of what comes up when
you Google my name.
I think as long as anonymity is being used
to protect people instead of giving an excuse
to be a dick — I think we can all agree people
feel a lot stronger about their opinions when
they're not accountable to them directly —
then the secrecy works. Our rules for using
real names have softened and I'd argue that
the content has stayed the same. Musicians,
like everyone, have a right to privacy if that
means going by something other than what's
on your birth certificate, then all the power
to you.

THE BEST ALBUMS OF 2014
Illustrations by Kim Pringle
FRASER DOBBS
Local: Beyond The Black Rainbow OST -
Sinoia Caves
Watcliing the ludicrous art-house experiment that was 2010's Beyond The Black Rainbow was an interesting introduction to the
work of local synth wizard Jeremy Schmidt,
also of Black Mountain. The pulsating, ana-
log-synth soundtrack was so good, it nearly
justified its nearly four-year wait for a proper
OST release. A paranoid, insidious and terribly infectious collection of digital instrumentation, it sits extraordinarily well even on its
own thanks to Schmidt's near constant tinkering. If you can find a copy of the very limited
vinyl run, it's well worth a buy.
Non-local: Ultimata II Massage -
Tobacco
Really, there are at least a dozen excessively good records we should be thankful
for in 2014, but Tobacco's latest is so bizarre
it warrants special mention. Just watch the
music video for the grimy "Streaker" and
revel in Thomas Fee's latest dip into insanity.
Detuned trashcan synths, the most disgusting drum machines, and a fantastically dark
adolescent use of profanity make this album
something overwhelmingly interesting.
CHLOE HOY
Local: Sweet Little Fantasy - Dominique
Fricot
This Vancouver indie-folk artist never fails
to impress with his soulful voice, powerful tunes, and crafty melodies to switch up listeners' moods throughout an album. I've
yet to hear him perform live but this release
was, dare I say, flawless?
Non-local: Losers & Kings -
The Downtown Fiction
Without a surplus to spend on music this
year, I mostly stuck to album previews and
too many YouTube streams. (My physical
copy collection hates me.) However, I did
pick up this gem, whose rock-infused summertime pop songs kept me awake during
long transit rides.
more straight for the jugular. Total devastation from start to finish.. fg
Non-local: Lost in the Dream - The War
on Drugs
No contest. Without a doubt, I've listened
to this album more than any other this year
and I felt emotionally attached to it almost
immediately. I missed them at the Biltmore
but caught both shows at the Rickshaw in August and they were outstanding. Beer commercial lead guitar for the win!
ERICA LEIREN
NATALIE HOY
Local: Flies & Lancaster - Alea Rae
My favourite local release of the year has
to be Flies & Lancaster by Alea Rae. It's
only a split single but the ambient folk trio
has such an intriguing sound; the whimsical
nature and underlying complexity of their
material resonate with my fragile mind.
Non-local: Forever Halloween -
The Maine
I've never fully warmed to the idea of album reissues, but The Maine can truly do no
wrong. The five additional tracks on Forever
Halloween are a fitting blend of the band's
pop-rock origins, and the moody rock sound
they possess today. It's a treat to see them
evolve and earn continued success with every release.
Local: The Enigmas Live! - The Enigmas
I saw The Enigmas at The Imperial last
month and their moebius awesomeness re-
ignited my excitement at their live DVD
released earlier this year. Like a nuclear explosion of garage-riff fun, from the "danger
ahead" cover art to the 18 killer cuts, you can
dance all night to this one. It's the next best
thing to being there — and if you were there,
you may see yourself in the audience shots.
(Sheilagh and Janis: that's you!)
Non-local: Slow Phaser - Nicole Atkins
I really loved Nicole Atkins' single ''Girl
You Look Amazing" off her album, Slow
Phaser. The first time I heard it, I thought it
was something new by Chrissie Hynde (and
it's been stuck in my head ever since). What a
voice! A great song to sing around the house
or in the car on your way to a party!
COLEMAN INGRAM
Local: Curse of the White Widow -
Hoopsnake
*
I called this Squamish doom metal three-
piece's debut my favorite local album in
2012 and they have done it again. Same harsh
stoner/doom sound but less meandering and
JAMES OLSON
Local: SIT - Dead Soft
Not only an incredibly strong debut but
a solid alternative rock record all around.
Tracks like "Everything" and "Never Forever" are not only some of the best rock
11
STAFF SOUND OFF songs made by a local group this year, but
they're some of the best rock songs made by
any band this year periods. Dead Soft's debut succeeds at not only acknowledging their
influences but by crafting a truly memorable
body of work. K|
Non-local: Shelter - Alcest
I didn't know much about Alcest before engrossing myself in the breathtaking beauty of
their fourth record. All I knew was that after
one listen of the ethereal "Delivrance," I was
hooked. Neige and company have completely shed their black metal trappings and the
result is one of the most haunting and uplifting artistic statements of the year.
JASPER WRINCH
MAX WAINWRIGHT
Local: SIT - Dead Soft ■..-     -     / - ^
I love big guitar music, but none this year
was bigger than Dead Soft's self-titled album. While mixing shades of all our favourite '90s bands simultaneously, those fuzz
guitar choruses pack enough heat to fuel Mc-
Conaughey's ship past the wormhole. To put
it simply, I'll pick Vancouver's most ubiquitous band because in their hands, rock never
sounded so disarmingly intimate while reaching the stars .;ff|
Non-local: Salad Days - Mac DeMarco M
We've always known Mac DeMarco was
a goofball. He's written this persona into his
music from the start and Salad Days is no
exception. (I still chuckle at the impish utterance of "shit" that introduces "Brother.")
Though classic DeMarcoian moments like
this are plentiful in Salad Days, they don't define it. With such thoughtful and well-written
songs, Salad Days may even overshadow De-
Marco's own persona.
Local: A Dada Plan is Free - Dada Plan
With the year drawing to an end, I can say
with feigned confidence that the late September evening at the Media Club where Dada
j Plan opened for Ought was the musical highlight of my year. Their recent debut, A Dada
Plan is Free, is a hazy modern masterpiece
that easily takes the cake as my favourite local release.
Non-local: More Than Any Other Day -
Ought
Ought's LP More Than Any Other Day
sounds like it was taken straight out of the
New York's CBGB and implanted firmly into
the top spot for 2014. §1

STAFF SOUND OFF  ■ ALEX HUDSON'S MONSTER OF THE WEEK
By Esmee Colbourne II Photography by Konstantin Prodanovic
Illustrations by Brandon Cotter
"Rather be restless / than barely have a
heartbeat / waking up a monster / you know
that it's a good week."
Lyrics from Monster Of The Week, the
sophomore album by Vancouver's Rec Centre, caters to everyone trapped thinking about
the past, present, and future.
Alex Hudson, the musician behind Rec
Centre, drew most of his inspiration for Monster Of The Week from the aesthetic silliness
of modern sci-fi and murder mysteries. "It's
a hobby that takes up a large part of my brain
every single day. There hasn't been a day in
the last two years that I haven't thought about
the album obsessively." Hudson admits to being driven half-insane by the work he has had
to do on this album — but that being said,
Monster Of The Week's whole purpose was
to challenge Hudson to express himself by
creating music he'd never sought out before.
A completely synth album meant Hudson had
to leave his comfort zone: "Being synthier
was a conscious decision just to make it difficult for myself."
Hudson seems to make a habit of pushing
himself. When writing, he becomes highly
personal and observational of his surroundings. The lyrics of Monster Of The Week are
closely connected to moments of his life,
including a trip to California, almost losing
his small munsterlander, losing people he
loved, and last year's high school reunion.
"My 10-year high school reunion was fun. I
got drunk and talked to lots of people who I
hadn't thought about in a decade. Leading up
to it, I worried a lot about what it symbolized. I'm scared of getting old, and my high
school reunion reinforced that I'm not exactly
young anymore. That fear inspired almost every song on the album — either directly or
indirectly."
REC CENTRE
15  MY 10-YEAR HIGH SCHOOL REUNION WAS FUN. I
GOT DRUNK AND TALKED TO LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO I
HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IN A DECADE. LEADING UP
TO IT, I WORRIED A LOT ABOUT WHAT IT SYMBOLIZED.
I'M SCARED OF GETTING OLD, AND MY HIGH SCHOOL
REUNION REINFORCED THAT I'M NOT EXACTLY YOUNG
ANYMORE. THAT FEAR INSPIRED ALMOST EVERY SONG
ON THE ALBUM, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. |
Monster of the Week is serious, personal,
and addresses some fairly heavy themes, but
Hudson also considers all his songs to be
lighthearted in some way. "Every song has
lines that make me laugh, or little jokes that
are intended for a specific person. I like writing a lyric knowing that Jay, or my buddy
Mike, might think it's funny".
Although two years ago Hudson didn't
even know how to play the piano, he worked
painstakingly to create a keyboard-based album. "All the keyboard playing in this album
is incredibly rudimentary ... I'm relearning
them and I can't believe how simple they are,
but they were the limit of my ability then."
With a history of writing on guitar, it was
a major departure for Hudson's writing process when learning how to write on the piano.
"If I was just Alex Hudson, I'd be a guy with
an acoustic guitar and a bunch of Dave Matthews covers ... In two albums and an EP,
there hasn't been a single acoustic guitar and
that was very conscious." Hudson needed to
work through and write nine or 10 songs before he began to feel comfortable and confident with his work.
Exaggerated and ridiculous, Hudson melds
the brash, futuristic qualities of shows like
Fringe and The X-Files to his music; he enjoys the arcs common to fantastical shows,
and how there's a new profligate character
every week. "I like the idea of an episode that
is totally self-contained, with a big build up
and payoff. Then the slate would be wiped
clean and you could start again with the next
episode."
Hudson approached this album from the
rhythm section up, compiling sounds on top-
of the bass and drum sounds and — although
the keyboards are indeed surprisingly simple
— they pull all of the elements together into a
satisfying romp through a sci-fi soundscape.
Playing every instrument on the album
except for drums "and the odd synth or bass
here and there," Hudson would sit in small
bursts and layer, slowly but surely. Each song
is short and sweet; his articulate, storytelling
lyrics have a certain movement to them. "The
main thing about these songs is I don't want
to get bored, which is why there aren't any
third verses or third choruses. I don't want to
write it and I don't think anyone would want
to hear it." The only difference from the demos to the actual album is there are live drums
played by Jay Arner, which is evident from
the raw, almost crunchy synth sound.
A journalist himself, Hudson met Arner after interviewing him and his band Fine Mist.
They started to talk about recording music,
ended up living in the same neighbourhood,
17
REC CENTRE and then inevitably collaborated with each
other. "It becanffe very tangled very quickly,
and now I play in his band, and he helps me
with my stuff."
It might not seem like it from his connections today, but Hudson wasn't always this
entrenched in thpf|^ncouver music scene. As
a teen living on the north shore, he'd always
thought that there was "something cool happening over that bridge" and didn't get involved with it until his early 20s. It was during this time that Hudson's old band played
a show with Lotus Child and WordsOver-
Music, protobands of The Zolas and Said the
Whale. "I was in this band that I'm not going to name. It doesn't need to be named...
we pressed 1000 CDs and then broke up a
month later." These popular indie bands were
his intro — and first experience of the Vancouver music community — not just as a
musician, but as a music journalist. It excited
him to witness and write about people he was
a similar age to, people he knew, becoming
successful.
FoJ* now, Hudson is focussed on making
good, compelling music and developing his
sound through the mask of Rec Centre; he
isn't really trying to become famous or making it big. Rec Centre will not be touring this
album, as Hudson is content with where he
is in his life. "Playing live shows feels like a
|$i&£ work and not as much payoff from the
strejsS."
Rec Centre's clean, rhythmic sci-fi,music
makes the listener want to dance, instead of
run, from the impending doom and horror of
an alien invasion. A soundtrack to a backyard
BBQ in a dystopian city, Monster of the Week
is sprinkled with catchy hooks, driving bass,
and the melancholic feel of time just slipping
away.
Monster of the Week is available now on
cassette and online via Rec Centres Bandcamp.

In an enigmatic blaze, 16 businesses were
devastated by a fire at the corner of Kings way
and Broadway on December 25,2009. These
businesses — including affordable, artist
studio units — sat on property purchased by
Vancouver real estate developer, Rize Alliance, in May 2007. While it was inevitable
that Rize would rezone and redevelop this
property, no dates had been set. The 2009
fire, as quickly as it scorched, roused the redevelopment process into motion.     ||§
And so, much like a well-integrated, gen-
trifying phoenix, rising (rizing) from a totally
accidental fire, this property development has
since been poised to grow on fertile ground.
The coming Rize buildings include a 150-
foot tower on 10th Ave and a 118-foot high-
rise on East Broadway. These edifices were
approved by the city, while being largely
rejected by the Mount Pleasant community,
both in public forums and petitions. The hollowing of public outcry came in step with
Rize's $6.25 million donation to the City of
Vancouver in the form of a community amenity contribution this past June.
Community amenity contributions (CACs)
are legal cash contributions made by property
developers in exchange for rezoning permits
to build. CACs are dispersed between daycares, infrastructure initiatives, and cultural
centres. Essentially, this is a dollars for feet
trade, and in this specific case, 4.5 of the 6.25
million donated ended up getting divided between five existing arts organizations in the
Mount Pleasant area.
Of these five organizations — VIVO, C-
Space, Western Front Society, Grunt Gallery, and Arts Factory  —  I spoke with
representatives from two regarding their relationship with the Kingsway Rize development and what it's like to accept much needed money from nefarious hands.
In a phone interview, Executive Director
of Western Front Society, Caitlin Jones, tells
me how the $1.5 million her organization received will help them secure tenancy in their
current location. "What it doesn't alleviate,"
Jones qualifies, "are overall costs of artist
studio space and new younger arts organizations popping up in the neighbourhood."
Jones is careful not to define the current
CAC system solely by its failings. She speaks
more of the intricacies associated with Vancouver's art ecosystem. "It's a very complicated issue," Jones states. The fact that this
CAC went to existing arts groups in Mount
Pleasant "is a really important development
in the realm of these community amenity
contributions." Yet a progressive amendment
on an unsustainable system is still a cause for
caution. Jones elaborates, "It would seem to
have an adverse effect, that you're gentrify-
ing your neighbourhood, but then trying to
alleviate that by a cash contribution."
In the future, Jones suggests that the city
take a multi-pronged approach to arts and
culture funding. "They cati support major
40-year-old institutions like the Western
Front, but they also have to provide the space
for young students to start their own artist-
run centres." A humble hope, Jones would
like to see small-scale spaces like Red Gate
or (the now closed) Zoo Zhop, "continue to
be able to exist, without being shut down by
the city."
IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY, GET MONEY
21
I In another phone interview, program director Glenn Alteen of Mount Pleasant's Grunt
Gallery shares similar sentiments. Grunt was
grateful to receive $400,000 from the same
CAC: "In some ways, I'm happy they listened. It is a progression from giving people
free space, which isn't free, as W2 found
out."        •  .p^^^' '        ■Y%p:*^^><
Alteen credits Vision Vancouver and our
newly re-elected mayor, Gregor Robertson,
with keeping the arts agenda on the table.
At the same time he questions what Vision's
"redevelopment policies have done to artists,
compared to what they've done for artists."
"The problem with Vision Vancouver has
never been their support of the arts, it's been
more their support of the development community," he explains. This, it seems, is Vancouver's Catch 22. That consistently gentri-
fying a city through condo development and
then directing money from that condo development back into the arts, creates a self-impeding system.        gj)
This system of dual endorsement is something worth questioning. How evenly divided
is the city's support of arts and development?
I sit down with local gallery curators Andrew
Volk and Katharina Schulz to discuss the
topic. Two of the four founders of Skylight
Gallery located just north of Mount Pleasant,
both have experience running small-scale
arts spaces, but Volk is a veteran in the field.
For the past eight years, Volk has run or co-
run six independent arts spaces. Among these
was Glen 360, which ran for two years and
hosted some of the city's — and the country's — best musicians. In spite of this success, Glen, and all of Volk's venues over the
years, have eventually closed. Volk explains
that this is, "for a variety of reasons." Sometimes the lease was short-term, sometimes
the parties got too big, and sometimes the
right people complained.
"The city will respond most emphatically
to noise complaints," says Volk. Even in areas zoned as industrial, where most of Volk's
"THEY CAN SUPPORT MAJOR 40-YEAR-OLD
INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE WESTERN FRONT,
BUT THEYfALSO HAVE TO PROVIDE THE
SPACE FOR YOUNG STUDENTS TO START
S     THEIROWN ARTIST-RUN CENTRES." I
22
IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY, GET MONEY art spaces were located, condo developers
come in, looking to spot zone and build.
"They have a deal with the city. Condo guys
basically say to the city that no one can make
noise around where they're building because
it will disrupt their tenants and make property value go down." If noise is already being
made in a rental unit, the city will pressure
landlords to evict unwanted tenants.
So how does an emerging art space avoid
being suffocated by the city? Apparently the
answer is don't do anything illegal. Volk and
Schulz explain how they've had to find creative new ways to do art exhibitions in order to stay afloat. "We're doing everything
we can. I feel like we're an American public
school or something," Volk jokes. "Maybe
we could rent out that little square over there
•Jffbr $20?" -ffl| •"■ ■ ;|§|§|j|,    :|^|p^''|

As far as CACs go, Volk says "We wou
be very happy to have one," though 1
doesn't see that happening anytime soon, j
fact, Volk says, "It's just going to get hard
for people at the bottom. If you're not i
established gallery, then fucking get esta
fished. If you have no money, it's best to g
some. The main thing I've learned is that a
pays and that if you want to make a spa<
legit and make it work you've really just g
to work harder and have more ideas."
So to all the emerging artists and arts spa
es in the city that have been shut down, di
missed, and disheartened, and even to thoi
Rize CAC recipients: you just haven't bet
working hard enough. Find some money ai
figure it out.

HOSEHEAD RECORDS    1
by Meredyth Cole II Illustrations by Sharon Ko
II Photography by Brandon Lai
Patrick McEachnie, one half of Hosehead
Records, goes beyond the average music
fan's desire to compile a great record collection; his is filled with both records that he
loves and records that he helped create. Invariably these are the same thing: "I listen to
the records that I put out all the time, I put out
records that I love."
Since 2011, when McEachnie created the
label with childhood friend Mike Simpson,
the duo have Seen the release of 28 cassettes
and records. Starting the label was a decidedly low-key endeavor, requiring nothing more
than a Kijiji bargain tape duplicator and lots
of enthusiasm. The first cassette Hosehead
released was for Simpson's band, First Base.
Other cassettes followed and the success of
these initial tapes allowed Hosehead to start
releasing vinyl, a move they were happy to
make. A vinyl devotee, McEachnie is glad to
see the days of cassette making behind him.
Though still relatively new, Hosehead Records is even newer to Vancouver. Earlier
this year McEachnie moved here from Toronto and already has releases from two local
bands scheduled for early 2015. First up is
the debut release by Fashionism, "the most
exciting thing in my world right now" according to McEachnie, and then an LP from
Nervous Talk to follow. With McEachnie's
co-conspirator still living in Toronto, the bi-
city setup has allowed Hosehead Records to
work with talented musicians from a much
broader swath of the country than before.
"I probably wouldn't have been able to release [Fashionism and Nervous Talk] had I
not moved here," says McEachnie.
It seems like Hosehead grows and changes
with the lives of its two founders, acting like
a time capsule of the last four years. "When
[Simpson and I] were both in Toronto, we
were doing a lot of Toronto and Ottawa
bands. I was living in Guelph, Ontario for
a while and we had Guelph and Kitchener
bands and since I moved out here, I have
obviously been going to shows and learning
about bands out here."
The process of finding bands for the label
is also personal. McEachnie won't consider a
band unless he knows his partner will also be
enthusiastic, and many of their collaborations
are the result of pre-existing friendships.
24
HOMEGROWN LABELS MQ "THERE ARE LOTS OF AMAZING CANADIAN BANDS
THAT WILL NEVER HAVE THEIR RECORDS PUT OUT
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FROM NEW YORK OR LA OR
Hff "1\ ;iii_H   ;^   SEATTLE."  :        ■'■■■'   W ■■■■:     '.
Alternatively, a connection with a band might
evolve out of admiration for their previous
work. In 2012, McEachnie's record of the
year was Nervous Talk's seven-inch Introductions and he immediately became interested in working with them. After moving to
Vancouver and befriending the band, plans
for a record immidiately materialized.
But the easy-going way McEachnie approaches his work with Hosehead is deceptive: the behind-the-scenes intricacies of creating a record are extensive. "It takes a long
time to make a record, from recording to final
pressing -tend that whole time I'm happy
I'm doing it," he says.
From their unabashedly Canadian name,
to the toque-emblazoned website banner,
Hosehead records is a tremendously patriotic
label. McEachnie sees their focus on Canadian bands as a welcome resistance to an unbalanced music scene: "Most of my interest
lies in putting out Canadian records. There
are lots of amazing Canadian bands that will
never have their records put out because
they're not from New York or LA or Seattle," he says. Although McEachnie thinks
Canadian artists are especially deserving of
attention, he happily works with bands from
south of the border, and the company's reach
is growing. Hosehead will be releasing their
"first ever band from Europe" in early 2015:
a reissue of The Modern's 1979 record Year
of Today.
His work with the record label, and a love
of live music and historic venues, has allowed
McEachnie to bypass the dreaded adjustment
period that befalls many new arrivals to Vancouver. In fact, it seems that McEachnie has
settled in effortlessly to what is allegedly an
insular scene. But more than just appreciating local music, McEachnie is making a contribution to a scene he loves — and one that
is happy to have him.
Releases from Hosehead Records are
available at Neptoon, Red Cat, Luke s General Store, and Audiopile, And keep yer eyes
peeled for a seven-inch from Fashionism and
Nervous Talks debut LP, scheduled for early
2015 m

THE HINDENBUR&Jll       .     f
by Brody Rockstad II Illustrations by Tara Bigdeli
II Photography by Emma Djilali
While still a relatively new venue to the
Vancouver scene, the Hindenburg's origins
go back several years.
When owner David Duprey returned to
Vancouver from San Francisco in 2004, he
saw a town stifled by onerous regulations and
authority figures averse to any form of fun -
and opposed to anything that was seemingly
"different." According to Duprey, there was
no debate about Vancouver's moniker: "Anything that was happening that was fun was
scary and it meant p<|tential danger. We were
No Fun City. Hardcore."
Since then, Duprey and his business partner have done a lot to combat the title. He
sought out to create venues that were discordant to the then conventional Vancouver
scene, showcasing live acts that resonated
with and fermented the alternative community. His accomplishments have been considerable thus far, creating an impressive list of
spaces that include the Rickshaw Theatre, the
Emerald, the Narrow, the Fox Cabaret, the
Rumpus Room, a collection of art galleries,
and now the Hindenburg.
"What I do 4s alternative," says Duprey.
"There's enough normal shit out there.
There's enough stuff that's top 40 and boring. What I do with all of my spaces — and
28
VENEWS the Hindenburg is no different — is I create
alternative spaces where you can have some
wacky experiences, where you see something
you've never seen in your life."
I describe my experience of seeing The
Revered at Shindig a couple of weeks prior
to our interview. The band is part music act
and part performance art, mixing storytelling
and existential musings into an odd and often
comical display of dramatic tension. When I
saw them, I wasn't quite sure just what the
hell I was watching — and I enjoyed the confusion.
"The chaos!" Duprey replies. "I mean, it's
what I want to see and I think that it adds to
the fabric of the universe, right? It just makes
things more fun."
It seems fitting then that Shindig, CiTR's
annual battle of the bands, has found a new
home at the Hindenburg as of this year. Duprey has been an avid attender of Shindig
since its inaugural show back in '83: "I wanted it. I wanted it so bad. It's such an integral
part of everything that is Vancouver ... I do
Shindig because I believe in it."
The Hindenburg itself is no stranger to
the alternative scene, and in its decades-old
existence has operated under names such as
John Barley's, the Cruel Elephant, the Hungry Eye, and Club 23. Now, through Shindig's tradition of showcasing local talent, the
venue continues to contribute to Vancouver
culture. Newly renovated and boasting an impressive new sound system, the venue is perfect for the battle of the bands-esque Shindig
29 "WHAT I DO IS ALTERNATIVE. THERE'S ENOUGH NORMAL SHIT OUT
THERE. THERE'S ENOUGH STUFF THAT'S TOP 40 AND BORING. WHAT
I DO WITH ALL OF MY SPACES I AND THE HINDENBURG IS NO DIFFERENT - IS I CREATE ALTERNATIVE SPACES WHERE YOU CAN HAVE
SOME WACKY EXPERIENCES, WHERE YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU'VE
NEVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE." I
events. The atmosphere is intimate and inviting, equipped with a games room upstairs, a
viewing balcony, two bars, and floor space by
the stage for those who want to get up close
and personal with performing bands. In other
words, it has everything you need to have a
good time.
Despite all of this, any entrepreneur knows
that nothing is guaranteed and success for a
new venue in Vancouver is never a.sure thing.
Duprey's thoughts on the Hindenburg's future holds a mix of hope, pragmatism, and
— unsurprisingly, given the venue's name —
self-deprecatory humour. "I love that place
and we've had some amazing shows there so
far, but is it going to work? I don't know. I
hope it does. I think it will. If it's not that'll
be a drag, and I'll lose everything and be
homeless living in a box."
When I ask Duprey what makes a night a
success at the Hindenburg, his response says
it all: "I want you to walk in and have the best
time ever, and not know why you had it, and
see some band that you can't believe, and go
'What? Where did they come from?'"
The Hindenburg is located at 23 West Cordova in Vancouver. Catch the Shindig acts
happening every Tuesday night at the Hindenburg from now until December 16, with
semi-finals taking place in January.

As all good reviews start out with anecdotes, here's one: I was recently in an argument about the merits of bands reforming
without new material to justify yet another
tour. I was firmly on the side of "selling out."
It takes a powerful display to completely
change someone's mind, but Slowdive's recent stop at Vancouver's Commodore Ballroom managed just that. Not only did the
recently-reunited fj|British shoegaze band
completely justify their presence on this* side
of the Atlantic, they did so with such thorough and vivid intensity as to leave all expectations shattered.
Slowdive have always struck me as a particularly fascinating band. While their second album, Souvlaki, managed to etch itself
into the music nerd's catalogue of essential
records —- alongside My Bloody Valentine's
Loveless — as a definitive moment in shoegaze music, the band itself was never, in their
original iteration, commercially successful
or critically lauded. Their last album, 1995's
Pygmalion, barely managed to get a proper
release before the band were unceremoniously dropped from their label, Creation, and
the band broke up soon after. The ultimately
glazed-over Pygmalion, and the group's lack
oi; serious success in the '90s, makes their reunion all the more enticing, and their live act
managed to completely cement their return
nearly two decades later.
Although it would be correct to call slow-
core titans Low the opening act, the astounding applause their half-hour set was graced
with would have had you thinking they were
the headliners. It seemed little secret that
at least some in the crowd had come to see
Duluth, Minnesota's claim to fame first and
foremost.
The band was humble and in amazing form, outperforming every other time
they've played in Vancouver by miles. Perhaps it was the context of performing before a crowd of shoegazers, but Low made
giant strides to accommodate the overdrive-
seeking, distortion-haunted audience as their
signature quiet, tortoise-paced set blossomed
brilliantly into crazy jam-band noise solos.
Frontman Alan Sparhawk channelled more
than a little of Yo La Tengo's Ira Kaplan in
his guitar wizardry, from introspective plucking to down-and-out fuzz rock.
Slowdive's overwhelming success at the
Commodore was unexpected and, at times,
almost too much to take in. Much of their set
consisted of tracks from Pygmalion, and putting a solid stop to my "selling out" debate,
the band played these songs very honestly,
and very openly. It was apparent just how
much fun the quintet were having finally getting to play these songs live for a crowd of
people, even if half the crowd hadn't been
born when they were first recorded and released. The big numbers on their setlist, of
course, pulled from Souvlaki, whose loud-
quiet-loud moments almost veered into Mog-
wai territory, and where the most ears recognized the impending walls of noise.
Souvlaki has never struck me as a partic-.
ularly loud record, but hearing the opening
chords of "Souvlaki Space Station" before
the thunderstrike of delay-soaked guitar
noise was a profoundly changing experience.
The band was very, very loud, and the explosions of reverb were not only fantastic but
also completely changed my mind about how
their original records were really supposed to
sound.
!'.:'?iij{vj; /
The hearing damage was well worth the
wait. Judging by the pen mics pointed into
the crowd from the stage, Slowdive will have
a live album coming sometime in the near
31

O HEROES OF SHINDIG, PT.l
by Elijah Teed II
Illustrations by Alison Sadler
You can smell it hanging in the dry air:
the subtle whiff of mothballs on vintage merino wool; the woodsy perfume of beard oil,
wafting from a faux lumberjack. That's right,
everyone — autumn is here, and Shindig is
back in full force.
"What's Shindig?" you ask, from your
hole in the ground. Only one of Vancouver's
oldest and most revered independent music
traditions, now celebrating its 31st anniversary. Both a competition and showcase of local talent, Shindig has seen over 800 diverse
and awesome acts get drunk and rock out on
stage. Whether you've neglected to come out
on a Tuesday this fall, or you've seen every
act this Shindig season, Discorder has the
lowdown on each of the nights' winners to
bring you up to speed.

IAN WILLIAM CRAIG
A Turn of Breath
(Recital)
Nearly five years ago, I had the pleasure
of attending Ian William Craig's performance
"Because it Speaks of Nothing Speaking Everywhere" as part of the 10th annual Signal
& Noise Festival. For the show, Craig sat at
the centre of a semi-circle of small cassette
recorders where, over the span of 20 minutes,
he proceeded to layer and playback looped
recordings of his voice in real time. After a
shaky start, the music began gaining momentum, luring in those willing to be caught in
its hypnosis. The performance left a lasting
impression. This was not only due to the music, but also to the simple, purely analog, and
wholly archaic process, which left little to be
demystified.
Craig has come a long way since then, as
evident in the aptly named A Turn of Breath
(his most recent album on Sean McCann's
Recital label.) Though Craig's scope remains
analog tape and operatic vocals, his breadth
of sound has increased. Guitar and organ
parts ease effortlessly into Craig's songs> but
they too feel as ghostly, as ephemeral, as the
rest.
It is this quality of ephemerality that most
distinguishes Craig's music; as if listening to
A Turn of Breath instigates a momentary rift
between our dimension and another, where
magical sounds reside. Given the nature of
his imperfect creative process, it's astonishing how delicate Craig's music actually is. -1
would even go so far as to say that playing
this record repeatedly feels risky, not unlike
the act of pushing a house of cards to the
brink of its collapse.-
A Turn of Breath is a tapestry of musical sources; Certain songs focus primarily
around Craig's voice while other songs force
the grit and grime of tape mechanics into the
foreground. "TEAC Poem" strikes a nice balance between the two, while the two-part "A
Slight Grip, A Gentle Hold" is simply stunning, with the shiver-inducing lines: "I allow
my heaviness / A gentle hold / A slight grip
/ Knowing something has shifted / Knowing
something has connected." Sung by Craig,
these lines are enough to make one stop and
appreciate the power of voice as an instrument. This is especially the case in a realm of
music where vocals are typically buried deep
in the mix, if they are present at all. - Adrian
Dziewanski
F&M;|
At Sunset We Sing
(Self Released)
Remaining firmly Canadian, while borrowing from Fado, a form of music harking
from Portugal that pays homage to tales of
the sea and the life of the poor, Vancouver
band F&M release their newest album, At
Sunset We Sing. The album's sleeve notes
offer insight into this influence: "Born from
broken bones and promises, this record grew
from a conscious decision to move our hearts
and sorrows to Portugal."

UNDER REVIEW ■bl
Comprised of bandmates Rebecca Anderson, Ryan Anderson, and Bryan Reichert, At
Sunset We Sing starts out subtly, with just a
guitar and vocals. Simple but profoundly
beautiful musicianship has long been a hallmark of F&M and opening track, "Hands
In" continues that tradition. Ryan sings "I'm
down /I'm down / I'm down for anything
you have planned." When he exhales at the
one minute mark it sounds like a choking effort not to cry and the cascading piano adds
clarity to the pain at the song's core.
It is Ryan that we first hear on second track,
"And We Will Mend Our Broken Hearts," before Rebecca's stunning voice emerges. This
track introduces her to the listener and from
here she moves into the haunting reworking
of the late Russian Viktor Tsoi's song "Kuku-
sha." F&M's version is engrossing and commands a stillness from listeners — a glimpse
of what is to come on "I Have Never Seen
Such Darkness."
The aural impact of At Sunset We Sing is
reminiscent of The Beach Boys at their best;
but like the surfin' Californians' Wild Honey, you can't help but wonder if At Sunset
We Sing captured all F&M was capable of.

MONGOSKATO §   |
I Don't Give It
Filled with plunky instrument samples,
euphoric synth lines, and snappy percussion,
/ Don't Give It immerses, delights, and titillates listeners like a high-powered Jacuzzi
filled with orange soda. It is tumultuous and
chaotic, pleasant, and cyclical. m
Outdoing the album's warmth is its stylistic
variability. Songs change from soulful, funky,
and intimate into whimsical and detached
with just slight changes to the mix. Within
the first few measures the album shows off
this shifting, transient nature. (A good example of this is opening track, "Fela".)
/ Don't Give It is always busy but never
overcrowded. Mongo Skato thrives by adding layers of skittering percussion and meandering synths, but does so without making
the mix sound muddled or irritating. The album is packed with action and detail. Even
the slowest tracks command the attention of
listeners. Rich percussive variety and vibrant,
sharp synth lines can innervate even the most
listless of listeners. Energetic and playful, /
Don't Give It has an ever-altering tempo and
intensity which makes it at once relaxing and
animated.
In true 1080p fashion, Mango Skato rocks
the tape compression. Dense, spastic, and
crisp drum lines resolve into pulsing, four-
on-the-floor kicks. The bouncy and energetic
43
UNDER REVIEW percussion present on tracks like "Flythrua"
and "A Mouth Erect Backing Track" are reminiscent of producers like Mouse On Mars
and Urban Tribe. / Don't Give It is full of en-
dorphin-steeped synth patches and samples
akin to the work of artists like The Field and
Stereolab. Mongo Skato hybridizes relentlessly between different dance genres without diluting the qualities of any one of them.

CORSAGE ■§.  .■   -;|}
A Procession of Dreams ||
(Emblem Records)
For Corsage fans, this latest album is a
must-have; for those of you new to the monumental Vancouver band, I envy the discovery you are about to make. A collaboration
between Phil Smith, Bill Napier-Hemy, and
their talented friends, Corsage has been an
ongoing project since 1981.
With Smith on vocals and Napier-Hemy on
guitar/theremin, they're joined by Ron Allan
on bass and John Cody on percussion, replacing earlier Corsage drummer Chris Taylor.
All are well-loved and nigh revered talents
in Vancouver's alternative scene, comprised
of members from The Pointed Sticks, Subhu-
mans, and The Wasted Lives, to name a few.
Anything that Smith and his friends do is
intriguing, entertaining, and bound to be lots
of fun. Among my favourite Corsage songs
are three from 1983's The Phil Smith Album:
Grecian Formula," "The Shame I Feel," and
I'm a Lion." On stage, Smith is theatrical
u
t(T>
and larger-than-life; his words drip with
portent. He's Vancouver's philosopher king,
with a majestic voice able to proclaim universal truths. With the help of his bandmates,
he can elevate music to the realm of art.
This latest album is a song cycle that tells
the story of an heroic journey, from pain, bitterness, and grief to transcendence. At the
opening notes of the first cut, "From Earth
to Heaven with a Smile" Corsage and producer Ron Obvious create a sound that is
both beautiful and sad to the point of pathos.
The work is all of a whole, but if I must pick
a favourite song, it is the cri de coeur/dance
anthem "As I Must Leave You." This track
totally kills, and the guitars at the end will
blow you out of the room.
The songs are much enhanced by the lovely violin-playing of Meredith Bates and Belinda Bruce's just-right vocals (reminiscent
of Volumizer's Shannon Oksanen). Talent-to-
watch Gina Hemy-Bain and the Hipposonic
Chorus add further percussive and vocal embellishment. In this new work, Corsage have
created something that is beautiful, uplifting,
and profound.
There is a saying by Albert Camus: "In the
midst of Winter, I discovered within myself
an invincible Spring." This record is the aural equivalent. Isn't that something we are all
looking for at this chilly time of year? - Erica

THEE MANIPULATORS
Simian Again
(Neptoon Records)
Hot on the heels of two reunion shows —
one opening for '60s garage rock icons The
Sonics — esteemed Vancouver group Thee
Manipulators have released their final seven-
inch. Recorded just before the band called
it quits a few years ago, the three songs that
make up Simian Again capture the true essence of Thee Manipulators.
While each of the three possesses its own
character, all share that familiar Manipulators
feel. "It's Excruciating!!" is a rambunctious
UNDER REVIEW garage rock blaster; propelled by a swirling keyboard riff and rapid fire drums, "It's
Excruciating!!" culminates in a crescendo
of wailing guitars. High pitched back-up vocals serve to compliment lead singer Mike
Roche's genuine sounding rock 'n' roll holler. "Cry Real Tears" is more of an R&B driven ass-shaker, with a bouncing beat, jangling
guitar, and rattling tambourine.
It is, however, the title track that really
stands out on this all too short EP. "Simian
Again" starts with a brilliant, bluesy guitar
hook and slowly builds. The track gradually introduces a thumping beat, a deep bass
line, rhythmic keys, and commanding vocals.
Each part contributes a layer to construct the
whole. Add in some hand clapping and some
good ol' Manipulators fun as they call out in
unison "Walk like an ape / Talk like an ape"
and you have a serious rock *n' roll song from
a rock 'n' roll band that doesn't take itself too
seriously.
It's a shame that Simian Again is Thee Manipulators final recording, While they do go
out with a bang, after listening to these three
songs (over and over) one can't help but wonder what could have been if these sessions
had produced an entire album. I guess we just
have to hope that Thee Manipulators get the
rock 'n' roll urge every once in a while and
treat us to one of their blazing stage sets!

ELECTRIC YOUTH
Innerworld
(Last Gang)
A whole new breed of sound is generated
on Innerworld, the debut album from Toronto
band Electric Youth. An album synthesized
unlike any other, Innerworld is caught in
liminality between the present and the future.
Electric Youth, comprised of long-time duo
Austin Garrick and Bronwyn Griffin, have
written a perfectly orchestrated concoction of
electro-pop songs that embody the free spirited and youth driven culture of today.
Fluidity and transience drive the album to
its wondrous, dream-like state, Innerworld
flows at a pace that is similar to waves crashing onto a beach — constant, yet jagged.
Consistency is a key element of Innerworld,
a collection of songs which never peaks, but
instead stays true to a singular creative tone,
Innerworld's stylization is precise. Evety
note serves a distinct purpose in creating an
overall sound that works together to fulfill
an artistic vision. Motion through time and
space are painted with the synthesized and
futuristic musicality of Electric Youth's production style. I
Innerworld explores the disoriented and
pleasure driven culture of today's youth, The
pains of being carefree are conveyed through
Electric Youth's understated and poetic lyricism, "Runaway/' the first single off of the
album, exemplifies a longing to attain true
freedom within the constraints of modem
UNDER REVIEW
45 society. With lyrics like|||'Maybe we could
just run away for good / Cause we're both
misunderstood," "Runaway" conceptualizes the wanderlust desires of the youthful
mind. "Tomorrow," the eighth track on the
album, illustrates spontaneity and vivacious-
ness with its transparent verse^and clean-cut
sound. Its |armonies are perfectly textured,
leaving the s^^MEnem(|fe^> linger J||
While we remain entrenched in the everyday workings of the worlditround us, there
lurks a desire to explore the unknown. The
liberating sensation of ■delving into a world
beyond the familiar can be found through
music, and Innerworld certainly takes you to
a place you never knew existed. - Alex Lenz
SKINNY KIDS
Strangers
(Kingfisher Bluez)
There is much to like about Skinny Kids'
new EP, Strangers. From its nostalgic hat tip
to '60s psychedelia to the Marc Bolan-esque
drawl of lead singer, Trevor Gray, the EP
echoes an age of kaleidoscopes, hallucinogens, flower power, and white go-go boots.
More than all of that, these self-professed,
reverb drenched, surf stampers, have created
a masterpiece that is impossible to put down.
Opening track "Stranger on the Highway" is
long steeped in warm distortion, wah wahs,
and infectious guitar riffs. "Psychic Down
the Road" is a short and sweet hip shaker,
that even Pulp Fiction's Mia Wallace could
lose herself to. lii
Tunes like these make it hard to discern
Skinny Kids from neo-psychedelia contemporaries, Tame Impala, Pond, and Temples.
Strangers fills a psychedelic space in today's
musical marketplace that is sorely lacking.
Truly a record for lovers of Disraeli Gears,
lo-fi, and sweet '60s throwbacks, Skinny
Kids are definitely a band to watch out for
more of in 2015. - Victoria Canning
RYAN « EMS WORTH .
Alone For the First Time
(Last Gang)
No stranger to Canada's electronic music
scene, Ryan Hemsworth combines a variety
of different sampling techniques and melodies on his new album, Alone For The First
Time. As suggested by its title, Alone is comprised of somber tones, with lyrics characterized by love and loneliness. But unlike past
albums released by Hemsworth, Alone dives
into great lyrical depth.
Evoking the glittery, bubbly remixes Hemsworth has produced in the past, opening
track "Hurt Me" starts the album off with a
fast paced, yet haunting tone. Colourful synthesizers pair off with repeated lyrics by an
unfeatured artist. %m
Second track, "Walk Me Home," transitions into the melancholy melodies that come
to define the album. Featuring recording
artist Lontalius, breathing over the chorus:
"Leave me alone / There's no room for me
46
UNDER REVIEW / Left in your heart" contrasts nicely with
Hemsworth's replies to, "Never leave me
alone." Like the song*s shifting tonal waves,
conventional lyrical structures match well
with unique samples that build up and recede.
"Snow in Newark" functions well as the
single for the album. Even more so than in
"Walk Me Home," "Snow in Newark" feels
less like a Ryan Hemsworth produced track
and more like one produced by a lyrical artist.
These lyrical tracks mark a bold step forward
for Hemsworth, who in the past had demonstrated his own ability to create encapsulating
music with a complete absence of vocals.
One might question whether Hemsworth
had always wanted to make an album like
Alone or if it is the result of a natural evolution. While Alone is colourfully entertaining,
its lyrics and lyrical style are uncharacteristically conventional. The topics explored by
Hemsworth, don't extend very far beyond
love and loss, both banal topics in the world
of music. While in the past Hemsworth's music stood on its electronic beats, and their absence of any human voice, Alone combines
Hemsworth's formerly wordless music techniques with more typical lyrical stylings.
This composition is what makes Alone
so easy to listen to, and what marks Hemsworth's progression towards greater lyrical
depth in his music. Alone For The First Time
is a short but sweet listen for fans of Ryan
Hemsworth and electronic music alike.

KIM GRAY •§ / V
Backseat Bingo
(Resurrection Records) m
Trevor Kim Gray, the lead singer/guitarist
of Vancouver trio Skinny Kids, has gone solo
with his debut EP, Backseat Bingo. Backseat Bingo mellows out his band's surf-rock
stomping, but keeps the reverb-heavy production intact.
The lazy, stoner tempos are easier going
than what we've seen from Gray's previous
work. For example, the insistent hand claps
present on Skinny Kids' "Real Lost" have a
lot more energy than those backing the leisurely strum of Gray's own "Frank Sinatra."
Slow, droning riffs played over lackadaisical
drumming, complement this laid-back atmosphere, making Backseat Bingo reminiscent
of a sedate ocean breeze.
Several rock touchstones are featured on
the EP. "On Top" has a "Be My Baby" drumbeat and some Beach Boy worthy "woo-
hoos." "Why is Red?" adopts an Oasis sneer,
while "Slow 'Medication" has some of the
roughest recorded Bob Dylan-style harmonica playing in the history of the instrument,
which, given Gray's commitment to lo-fi, can
only be a compliment.
With most lo-fi favouring punk-rock stylings and fuzzed-out guitar solos, it is initially
disconcerting to see a lo-fi performer referencing his music as "doo wop." This approach seems inherently risky, as it's bound
to scare off Frank Sinatra purists and fans of
edgy lo-fi alike.
All these diversions from the Skinny Kids'
sound show Gray stretching his boundaries and faying out new approaches. So while
Gray seems better suited to his surfer day-
job — and while this release brings few new
ideas to the lo-fi table 9J| we shouldn't be surprised if Backseat Bingo influences Skinny
Kids to sound a bit more like The Ronettes
from now on. - Thomas Barker

UNDER REVIEW I    BARE THEIR TEETH
by Christopher Lennox-Aasen II Illustrations by Dana Kearley
II Photography by Noam Suissa
"What really worked is we all hate each
other and have nothing in common. So we all
just did our own thing, completely in a vacuum, and then laid that down." Ryan Fitzgerald's broadening grin reveals his sarcasm, the
Witch of the Waste vocalist leaning back in
his chair while his bandmates chuckle. After
a photoshoot outside in the crisp weather, the
band members and I have taken refuge in a
warm pub to conduct our interview.
The Witch of the Waste that debuted back
in 2010 is substantially different than the
five members sitting before me now. The
group has had a rotating slew of personnel
since its inception but through the adversity,
these guys have found a spark in their current
lineup. The band's motley crew is filled out
by Phil Jones and Peter Sacco on guitar, Michael Holme on bass, and Jeremy Gilmartin
on drums. When asked how this incarnation
came to be, Fitzgerald says it was simple:
"Phil was really good, and we knew him.
Jeremy was really good, and we knew him.
Mike was really good, and we knew a guy
who knew him." Fitzgerald looks around the
table at his bandmates,."and they aren't assholes."     .. ■ •;! '    fi
"I got a call from Ryan. When a band needs
a bass player because they're opening for
Gojira, you don't say no" says Holme, the
group's fifth and newest member.
Gojira is just one of the names on an already impressive'resume of bands Witch of
the Waste have shared the stage with. Intro-
naut, Cloudkicker, Norma Jean, Anciients: if
nothing else, the caliber of shows that Witch
of the Waste has played is testament to the
band's chemistry. It also helps that the blistering music they play is seriously genre-
bending. Witch of the Waste is a monster of
a band.
"I don't think we really fit in as hardcore,
metalcore, death metal, or whatever; we're
mushed into this ugly ball of everything,"
says Jones.
WITCH OF THE WASTE '""V
"WE WANTED IT TO SOUND THE WAY IT DOES WHEN WE PLAY
LIVE... THIS EP IS WARMER. NO TRIGGERS, NO SAMPLES, EVERYTHING YOU HEAR IS ALL ME DOING IT. IT'S REAL."   H
"We stood out, that's for sure," says
Gilmartin, commenting on the festivals
they've played that were mainly thrash or
death metal oriented.
I ask exactly how many shows they've
played this year, but the band seems to have
genuinely lost count. The fellows try to list
them off — many of which are remembered
through injuries suffered in hilarious mosh
pit-related incidents — but the truth is that
after playing a certain number of shows, they
all start to blend together. Following much
deliberation, Sacco declares; "It was the most
we've ever played in a year."
Despite this, Fitzgerald adds that "it
wasn't enough," to an agreement of nods and
"mhmm"s. This leads to Fitzgerald discussing tour plans for the New Year: "We'll do
something... we don't have anyone backing
us financially. For the most part, it's down to
>»
us.
Along with the shows and solidified lineup, Witch of the Waste have recorded their
upcoming sophomore release, a triumphant
bone-chilling six-song EP titled Made of
Teeth which Fitzgerald describes, in relation
to previous releases, as "faster, weirder, and
scarier.
»
49
WITCH OF THE WASTE  The EP was recorded by Mark McKitrick,
mixed by Curtis Buckoll, and mastered by
Stu McKillop from Rain City Recorders at
night over a period of almost two weeks. This
is a very different beast compared to their debut EP, All Other Voices. It further separates
Witch of the Waste from the overproduced,
technical oneupmanship that metalcore is
sliding into these days.
"We wanted it to sound the way it does
when we play live ... This EP is warmer. No
triggers, no samples, everything you hear is
all me doing it. It's real." says Gilmartin.
"Everyone was generally being themselves
on this record," says Sacco. "There are few
parts where Phil and I are playing the very
same thing."
"We wanted to boil it down," explains
Fitzgerald, "with the first EP, there was no
plan. Each song was sort of looked at individually. On this one, we knew where we .wanted
it to start and where we wanted it to end."
As for Fitzgerald's part, his lyrics are the
prose of nightmares, dreams, and the flow of
consciousness: "I didn't write anything until
the songs were written so that I could get a
flow and have it all work together ... I didn't
think of the writing as a very cognitive thing,
I was just responding to the music."
I ask what the resulting lyrics were about
and Fitzgerald takes a moment to think. "It
doesn't matter what it means to me. I'm just
the fucking guy who wrote it. I don't wanna
tell anyone what to think, or what to feel if
they hear it and read the words and it means
something to them, then that's what it means.
Once it's released, and there for people to
hear, it doesn't belong to me anymore."
"Saying that makes you sound like such
an asshole, man," says Sacco, and everyone
starts laughing again.
Made of Teeth will be out in the spring as a
digital download and on seven-inch. For the
groups next performance, catch Witch of the
Waste at the Rickshaw Theatre for Diecem-
b erf est on December 5.

51 IN GOOD HUMOUR
ADAM PATEMAN "^
by Evan Brow II Illustrations by Jenna Milsom
Adam Pateman is a genuinely fun guy.
With his chummy beard and playful, almost
muppet-like voice, his casual humour, like
you and him are cracking up doing bits late
at a house party. That's part of what makes
Pateman such an effective stand-up comedian. He's engaging and lively: a peppy, witty
comic looking to pursue comedy wherever it
takes him.
Like most comics, Pateman had an affinity
for comedy starting at a young age. When not
obsessing over Weird Al Yankovic, he would
listen to Steve Martin records on repeat and
even went as Groucho Marx for Halloween
one year.
"In grade three, I acted out lines from the
trailer for the movie Cool Runnings to a
group of kids in a cul-de-sac near my friend's
house, and I made them all laugh really
hard," says Pateman. "I did an innocently
bordeirline-racist impression of a Jamaican
bobsledder and was instantly addicted to the
reaction I got."
Pateman grew to love performance, with
his first big foray onto the stage in grade 10.
Along with a few older friends, Pateman
wrote a sketch comedy play for the Vancouver Fringe Festival called "The Shabadoo Experiment." The show was a complex; surreal,
absurdist production that threw limits out the
door. For example, in the play Pateman "sang
a love song about a centaur named Daria the
Quadraped and there were two characters
called 'The Dream Lions,' who were from
a place called 'Bubblegum Hell,' which was
an insane dream-world where a giant ogre
would move people's apartments around like
blocks of Jenga."
With that same theatre group, Pateman
would go on to write and perform "Oliver
Piatt's Magic Spoon Orchestra," another
sketch comedy play: only this time, weirder and longer. While Pateman attended the
Douglas College Theatre Program from 2002
to 2005, he was always drawn to comedy
first, but specifically stand-up comedy.
"I did my first [stand-up] set the summer
after high school at the old Yuk Yuk's back
when it was at the Plaza of Nations during a
kind of comedy lull," says Pateman. "People
weren't particularly interested in going to
comedy clubs at the time I don't think, and
the place looked more like a strip club than
a place to see comedy. Instead of a light that
flashes and tells you when your set is done,
the host would tap a spoon against a railing
backstage. Five out of the seven people in
the audience were my friends, but one guy
who ran a hip 'alternative' weekly show on
Commercial Drive came down to see my set
and started letting me do his show at a place
called El Cocal."
Pateman soon became quite successful at
stand-up comedy and continued to perform
at Yuk Yuk's. Seven years after his start in
52
IN GOOD HUMOUR  August 2002, Pateman moved to New York
to further pursue comedy, hosting a show that
featured sets by Reggie Watts, Hannibal Bu-
ress, and regular Saturday Night Live writers.
Pateman then moved to Los Angeles to pursue comedy but ultimately decided to return
to Vancouver m though New York and Los
Angeles both presented Pateman with very
interesting experiences.
"I'm very fortunate that I started comedy
in Vancouver because the crowds here are
very smart and really make you work for the
laughs," says Pateman. "This community
fosters a lot of really great comics because
of it, and the skills I learned here translated
to New York very well because they too have
a very similar sensibility. There's also just a
never-ending list of things to do in New York,
which I miss sometimes when it's 1 a.m. here
and there's nowhere to go, including a bus
to get me home. Los Angeles also has a very
strong and smart comedy scene and it's another place that seems like a magnet for brilliant and talented comics. I just didn't like the
weather there."
Lately, Pateman has been pursuing a palpable passion project. As a part of CBC's
crowd-voted comedy show pitch program
ComedyCoup, Pateman, Max Mitchell, and
Brian Fukushima created the idea of Roll for
Damage, a Dungeons and Dragons-inspired
comedy series.
"It's a show about five people with totally
different and hilarious reasons for why their
lives are a mess and they all meet once a
week to play a pencil-and-paper role-playing
game as a distraction from it," says Pateman.
"Their real-world problems bleed into the
game and we use cool-looking indie-cartoon
illustrations by co-creator Brian Fukushima
overlaid on top of the footage to show what's
going on inside the imaginations of the characters. The show deliberately has no 'nerd
characters,' just interesting people played by
the best comedic performers we know."
As Pateman strides into more-scripted
comedy, it will be interesting to see how his
determined exuberance will translate onto the
screen. I fully expect him to display the spirited vigour he presents on-stage in everything
he does. B|

55 HARVESTING ROCK VN' ROLL CROPS DOWN ON CANDELA FARM
by Brett Mattson II Illustrations by Karl Ventura II Photography by Natalie Hoy
!!T»
I've got a trunk full of puzzles."
No, that's not a freaky sex jam from
East Van rockers Candela Farm's new EP,
,DADF#AD. It's just fact of life for the group's
frontman Andrew Candela, who's also a father of a rambunctious three year old.
"He can be pretty aggressive and has very
few inhibitions. He loves puzzles and is very
social, but has been known to hit other children. Toddlers are kind of little cavemen," he
adds.
And while life's not all caveman wrangling
and mind games for Candela, the former
singer/guitarist for pop-punkers Plus Perfect
says that having a kid has definitely had an
impact on his songwriting.
"It's made it more dystopian," he says, "because it's hard being a father. It's very rewarding but I worry way more now, about my son
and the world in general." However, taking
his personal concerns and placing them in a
more universal context turned out to be an incredibly fruitful pursuit for the band.
"In the moments where I could write, that
was a good way to say, 'I'm worried about my
family or my son' but then ask, 'Okay, where
are our larger anxieties coming from?'"
These new-found anxieties are plentiful in the lyrics of Candela Farm's new EP,
DADF#AD, which pairs ragged, upbeat
rockers with downbeat titles like "Sound of
Decay" and "Living in the End Times." Indeed, Candela alternates between sweetly
singing and belting out lyrics that are equal
parts vicious and cryptic over bright, bouncing grooves and sharp saxophone blasts.
"They're watching Athens burn / But there's
no one to cover the flame," Candela sings
on the album's closer, "Send in the troops /
Spending up all of the surplus / Armouring
cars driving us deep into end times."

i "IT'S MADE IT MORE DYSTOPIAN BECAUSE IT'S HARD BEING A FATHER.
IT'S VERY REWARDING BUT I WORRY
WAY MORE NOW, ABOUT MY SON
AND THE WORLD IN GENERAL."
"That's a rip off of a Slavoj Zizek book,"
Candela explains. "He has an idea of making
up fake nostalgia for something that didn't really exist."
Compared with the songwriting of Plus
Perfect, who broke up in 2012, the tone is
a natural evolution for Candela. "What was
I writing about before?" he asks himself.
"Love songs, selected history songs. Probably sex, but I still probably write about that."
As his lyrics grow more personal, the practical move for Candela to do was pick a more
personal name for this new band; a name for
a musician transitioning into adult life, without the time to maintain a consistent lineup.
"I can always make music as Candela Farm
and not have to call it by a new name [after
every lineup change] or have to worry about
replacing someone for a show," he says. "It's
more fun making it project based: either a recording or a show, and whoever is able to do
it does it."
As of now, the band's lineup consists of
Alex Cooper on baritone sax, Barry Higgin-
son on bass, Ryan Shimo on drums, and Tyler Mountenay on guitar. And while Candela
has nothing but great things to say about the
lineup, he's aware that personnel are bound
to change in the future: "I'm hoping it'll stay
kind of what it is right now, but I can't put
pressure on it. It's too hard to operate that
way as a band."
All of the players add their own personal
touch to DADF#AD, but what's also unique
is that all of the EP's songs were written and
performed in Open D tuning, which the confounding title is a reference to.
"It's one of the dronier tunings and is really
easy," Candela says. "The open D tuning [is]
warmer and looser, but there's also more of a
pulse behind the songs and a groove."
Of course, one could argue that there's
a double-meaning to the title, pronounced
"Dad Fad" for the uninitiated.
CANDELA FARM  "I'm a dad, so I'm going through different
life circumstances than the 20-somethings
who are playing music," he says. "It was kind
of a joke that would look cool in bold letters.
It's not really that clever but it's like an inside
thing for the three-million guitar players in
the world." 111
With Candela and his barnyard crew bringing their rock 'n' roll farmers' market to an
East Van neighbourhood near you, don't expect them to be rocking the block after midnight; late nights are no longer a fad for
this dad.
Following their release show last month
at The Lido, DADF#AD is now available as
a digital download and a limited run of cassettes from Boat Dreams From the Hill — a
trend more bands are following to help lower
the costs of releasing music. As Candela explains, "We're not going into debt for an LP
when most music is downloaded. A tape is
like a more expensive promotional card."
"I'm too old, man," he says. "Those six-
band shows that end at three in the morning?
That's too kid stuff."       f
Catch Candela Farm at Astorino s on December 12 for the appropriately titled Battle
of the Dads, where they'll be playing alongside other dad bands Shawn Mrazek Lives!
and The Flintettes.

CANDELA FARM ON THE AIR I
ALPHABET SOUP
Words & Photography by Rohit Joseph

*77iis interview has been condensed and edited for print*
While CiTR is known for representing a
diverse range of musical genres, about 13
per cent of the station's content falls under
the realm of "spoken word" programming f|
which includes this month's On the Air, Alphabet Soup. Co-hosted by Matthew Walsh,
Laura Tretheway, and Sarah Higgins, the
show focuses on creative writing and storytelling produced by MFA Creative Writing
students at UBC (a program of which the
hosts also belong to). As Discorder found
out, the show emerged from their desire to
take the initiative and provide a platform for
the unique creative writing coming out of
ubc. ■   vl§;-;
HOW DID ALPHABET SOUP GET ITS
START ON CITR?
Walsh: Hugo, the volunteer coordinator at
CiTR, came in and talked to our group of incoming MFAs about the radio station. I was
interested in having a radio show and so as he
was talking, I looked around the room to see
who else might be interested. There was one
other person in the room paying attention and
nodding and it was Laura. We decided to do
a radio show about what people are doing in
the MFA program.
Tretheway: And we picked up Sarah along
the way! w
WHAT ATTRACTED ALL OF YOU TO RADIO
PARTICULARLY? |§- -|j .;i^^|; • ' .   „ •
•
Tretheway: There are really great writing
podcasts out there. This is where I'm going
to sound a little bit pretentious, but there's
a really great New Yorker fiction podcast
that we've somewhat modeled our program
after. They have somebody read their story
and then talk about it. That's just a really fun
way to get into the story and sometimes they
sound better when they're read aloud. We
don't often get a chance to talk about our stories that way in the MFA program because
we're in a workshop setting where it's much
more about, "How are we going to fix this?"
But on the show, we're just talking about the
story in a fun, no-stress sort of way. I think
radio is really amenable to that.
ON THE AIR Higgins: I know part of the reason why
I want to do it is because I like radio and I
wanted to explore it. But there is very little, if
any, funding for radio dramas or storytelling.
For me, it was a reaction against that like,
"This will happen... even if you don't fund
me!"        . •# ■{$       W-''   J§
Tretheway: We actually did one of Sarah's
radio plays, which was a little tough at times
because we were very new to it and we just
did our sound effects like *bangs on table*
"Someone walks in the room!"
who are new to storytelling because we're
talking about how they write their stuff, why
they wrote that particular piece, and where
they're going to take it.
Tretheway: So it's a really craft-based
show but we try and be jokey and self-deprecating so that people will want to listen to us.
It's just supposed to be a fun take on creative
writing that happens around UBC campus.
WHAT'S   YOUR   FAVOURITE   STORY   OR
MOMENT FROM THE SHOW?
Higgins: I think it got the point across.
Walsh: The next one we do will be better
because we got skills now.
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE SHOW
TO SOMEONE WHO IS COMPLETELY NEW TO
STORYTELLING AND CREATIVE WRITING?
Higgins: We invite creative writers onto the
show, they read something they have written,
and we chat about it. It's geared for people
62
Walsh: When Nicole was on and read
all of her Google searches. That was really
funny! §|§
Tretheway: One of my favourite moments
from the show was from our very first episode. We were talking about words between
different countries. We had an Irish guest
so she taught us a bunch of Irish words that
are like slang but not dirty slang. More cute
slang, like "mankee." What does .mankee
mean again?
ON THE AIR Walsh: I don't really remember but I assume it's describing something that's wet,
rotty, or smelly.
Tretheway: Mankee is what you'd call a
bathmat when it got really gross. Like "Aw,
that bathmat's really mankee." That was one
of my favourite ones. But oh gosh, I shouldn't
say that... they're all good!
Higgins: I think my favourite moments in
the show happen when we stop talking about
the story and we just start riffing on writerly
things.
Tretheway: That's where the good moments happen; when we set up some questions then we go off and just talk. I like die
rapport the three of us have. We usually know
the people we are interviewing really well so
the best moments are totally uriscripi|d.
If you 're in the mood for great storytelling
or just some great banter, then check out Alphabet Soup every other Wednesday at 11:30
am. on 1019FMor citr.ca!
