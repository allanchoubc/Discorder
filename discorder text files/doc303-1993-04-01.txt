— WE WERE BORN...BORN
IN THE '60s
Dear Discorder,
I would just li ke to clear up a disturbing error commonly made regarding
Jim Morrison's Elvis-like enormity
during his final days.
You see, it's not that Jim had any
choice in the matter. It is just that his
soul became so immense that his
body had to swell to contain his vast
essence. Finally, when mere rolls of
flabby flesh could no longer contain
such a force, his soul had to escape
its mortal prison and seek lodging
among the ranks of Mama Cass and
other bloated yet spiritual musicians.
Luckily for fans of The Doors,
Jim has the tact not to materialize in
the form of clouds or 7-11 clientele,
hke some polyester-wearing, sequin-
bearing persons with geometric sideburns who will remain unnamed.
Just thought you needed to know...
Sincerely,
A Giri Who's Just Coming Back

Person Who Gave Her a Ride

Airhead,
To me, Generation X was a combo
where Billy Idol cut lus teeth trying
to infuse pop with punk fifteen years
ago.
Nowadays, this musical equation
has caught on big time with kids
who now view Billy as a flash poseur, preferring to look hke Neil
Although in my mid-thirties, I
maintain random listening to
COAST, CiTR, & Brave New
Waves, and sometimes feel as
though my ears have been exposed
to an aural blender. Hybrid crossbreeding has been the order of the
day for some time now with some
very interesting results (sampling
not being one of them).
But the wave of grunge coming
out of Seattle has admittedly thrown
me for a loop. I guess it's a case of
persistence paying off. 1970:
Stooges & MC5, 1977: Ramones
and Pistols, 1983: Husker Du &
s, 1991-The Year Punk
Broke! Actually this is the title of a
new documentary on Nirvana and
Sonic Youth touring Europe. Richard Hell reviewed Sonic Youth's
Goo, stating: "Goo's sound most
resembles late 60's psychedelic
bands. Vanilla Fudge, Iron Butterfly, Spirit."
Well, call me a conspirasist, but
when I watch and listen to Pearl
Jam and Soundgarden, it's hke
somebody's been tinkering with
the fucking time machine! Now
I'm seeing clubs advertising "disco
nites" and teenage girls walking
around in flares andplatforms. Just
to be on the safe side, I'm getting
the safety-pins and black leather
out of the closet so I won't be
caught off-guard five years from
now... nuthin's impossible as I
heard the Velvets are reforming!
Joking aside, I still think the
bottom line is that old adage:
"There's only two kinds of music:
good & bad!" The former including thelikes of MattJohnson, Belly,
Bob Mould, Fishbone, Black
Francis, & yes, Sonic Youth &
Nirvana.

On January 4th, 1993, 14 ex-volun-
tccrs and listeners of KCMU 90.3
(Seattle's biggest non-commercial
station, a la CiTR) filed a lawsuit in
the US district court, charging KCMU
station manager, Chris Knab, KCMU
director of broadcast services, Wayne
Roth, and the University of Washington for violating their civil rights
under the First Amendment Act and
the Free Speech Provision ofthe Wash-
[i The 1
filed
individually by each ofthe 14 plain-
nils, centers specifically around—
but is really only a catalyst for publicizing a whole nest of internal problems at the station—a memo issued
to the plaintiffs by the station manager which was used as justification
for the firing of the plaintiffs. [Believe it or not, even volunteers can
be legally restrained from volunteering their services. Another form of
oppression defined by KCMU as firing. Ed]
This started way back in October of 1992 at the KCMU staff meeting, when managemen
without any input from
posed  democratically
of the volunteers for the past several
years." Dedicated to "renewing KCMU
as a valuable community resource
that challenges, educates and informs
the public, and sustains a reciprocal
relationship with its listeners," CURSE
was actively operating around the
station by the beginning of November '92. CURSE are calling for the
resignation of station manager, Chris
Knab, and program director, Don
Yates, as a "principal goal...necessary
for the attainment of [CURSE] goals."
They have also set up a trust fund to
run the station when they (hopefully)
regain control of KCMU, either by
winning the lawsuit and/or negotiating with the Board of Regents at the
University of Washington.
The intermittent firing of aforesaid plaintiffs occured for similar reasons, for example: mentioning
CURSE on the air, talking
about CURSE to a listener
over the telephone etc..
from having any input."
Unfortunately, KCMU isn't the
first to abandon their publicly responsive diverse programming for
something a little more professional
(read financially successful). WXPN,
a formerly alternative station on the
grounds of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, began pandering to a baby boomer crowd: getting rid of student volunteers, dropping programs etc., much like KCMU
has been doing. WXPN has been setting an example that other stations
have been following, specifically, "reconciling the gap between community
services and financial benefit."
WXPN has enjoyed huge financial success with the syndication of
"World Cafe," which has been airing
on KCMUsince October. Ithascaused
a great deal of controversy be-
s obvious, it's a
pre-recorded show that
features such es-
ever, was exempted from these obligations because WXPN was so eager
to move into the Seattle market. Unfortunately, for station management,
something they can listen to for free,
as the latest Arbitron ratings show
that listenership has been cut from
.5* to .2%.
The other major change implemented by management was a software scheduling system (KCMU says
it is a catalouging program) that automatically formats and produces
playlists. It categorizes songs by mood,
energy, tempo, texture, beats per
minute, pattern and key. Songs can
also be dayparted (only played at
certain times of the day)or effectively
banned from the airwaves with a Never
Play This function! Although management tries to downplay the scheduling aspect of the program, (hat is the
real purpose.
you that 90% of KCMU's funding
comes from the public), and they are
showing (in CURSE's opinion) little
sign of relenting on tlieir new format
which features a tight rotation of spe-
cific, benign, and listenable cuts. In
management's opinion, they are offering listeners an eclectic mix of
rock, rap, reggae and world music.
Speaking with program director, Don Yates, he told me that CURS E
was "silly...ridiculous., .out there." In
his opinion , CURSE was formed be-
cause"volunteersdidn'tget their way"
and complaints were a matter of them
"throwing up whatever they could
think of." He said, "we're here for the
community" and seemed quite positive that the case would be dismissed
in court. In response to questions
about the finances ofthe station Yates
said, "We're doing fine with the budget," including that there was a 50%
a pledges at the last fundraiser
(Susan Ward from CURSE ui
predicted he would say so)
and that management was
happy with the way
things were going.
Regarding allegations of corn-
tor donations to supplement 90% of
its budget. Thus, the volunteers at die
station fell the quality of programming was being "denigrated into a
secondary position to ratings success." Feeling that diey didn't have a
forum for their views, die disi
rs formed CURSE(Cen-
sorship Undermines Radio Station
Ethics) to inform Ihe public of what
nfront management, who they felt
id been "slowly eroding the powe
,and the subsequent
firings of the plaintiffs, is in direct
violation of the KCMU
drafted in 1985. That i
lows volunteers many things, including the right to "voice one's opinion
without worrying about getting fired
for it." By die beginning of December '92, when an official CURSEstrike
was called, over thirty volunteers had
been fired or quit in protest of a
"battery of KCMU policies designed
i the public and volunteers
to the pub-
I remind
recieved only $10,000 in pledges,
translating into about$5000. According to CURSE, KCMU has i
zero growth and, allegedly, even Ihe
U of W is trying to distance themselves from the
vehemenently denied by Don Yates
who told me that he believes the U of
W is in support of actions implemented by di<
DJs now employed at die station are asked to sign a waiver saying
they will not mention CURSE on the
air. One of the plaintiffs was actually
offered his airshift back if he would
drop the lawsuit and sign the waiver.
The case is still pending, but Yates
says management "..is beyond this.
People are obsessing about it, it's all
over with."
For CURSE it isn't. The plaintiffs are asking for their positions
returned to them as well as an unspecified amount in punitive damages. Hoping to reach a settlement
with the University of Washington to
gain control of the station when and
if KCMU runs out of money, CURSE
thinks this will be by the end of the
summer. Ifyou wish to make a donation you can send it to CURSE, P.O.
Box 85839, Seattle, WA. 98145Ten
percent will go to operating costs and
Ihere
able to the donator at anytime unless
it is turned over to run the station.
Unfortunately, the irritating
;s vs. creativity and
freedom of expression" question
ally arise. The latter, almost without fail, falters in
the merciless glare of the former.
Happily, the KCMU vs. CURSE dis-
to be the exception to
the rule; public response has been
incredible. KCMU is currently being boycotted by C/Z records, Sub-
Pop, Cargo records, Capitol records,
EMI, RCA, Relativity records, Mammoth, and HighTone records. The
Afghan Whigs, Ween, and
Mudhoney have all performed at
CURSE benefits and Steve Fisk has
released a twelve inch single called
"Media Warrior," which will donate all the sales proceeds to CURSE.
Hundreds of protest letters have
the si
dthes
dent body at the U of W have
made a motion to accept
CURSE's goals and objectives as the student body's
official position. Stories about
the battle have appeared in Option,
Alternative Press, Spin, CMJ, Pulse,
the cover of Billboard magazine,
and even received coverage on MTV.
Also, the lawyer defending the plaintiffs, Todd Mayburn, is donating his
labour fees.
At this point it seems
unfathomable that CURSE will lose
the dispute. Even if they don't win
in courl public pressure might sway
the Board of Regents to reach a
settlement with CURSE. Don Yates,
unfathomable that CURSE will be

Well it's safe to say that you
are affiliated with the Shimmy-
Dis.
I guess so, I'm still friends with
Kramer and see him quite a bit.
He played on the record. His
organ solos are superb, and give
the record a real nice finish.
Originally, that song was a lot
slower, then Stanley came in
and sped it up.  He got these
thought it might just be easier if
they did them on their own. So
they recorded them, then we
went on tour with the Cocteau
Twins, and then I quit again at
the end of that.
Then what?
I took it easy and made some
demos for songs. I tried to raise
a Uttle money with the No. 6
single, as well as the "Anesthesia" sin gle for the Mint Tea label.
Out of this version and the
album's version, I like the early

even  save them.  Like  music,

seems inevitability is only remedied by nostalgia trapped in
Luna is a band from New York.
Their sound captures much of
the lingering momentum felt as
nine supersedes itself; estranging the familiar, foliage, and
friends. Composed of ex-Fee lies,
Chills, Damp and Galaxie 500
members, Luna come together
to make music they'd like to
listen to. Theirdebut,Z.«/iu/;ar*,
is a clean record with low reverb.
Discorder recently spoke with
Dean Wareham on matters
concerning va
stray hooks and n
gevity.
Discorder: I wanted to start
off by asking you about the B-
side on your single version of
"Ai.csthesia"iorlheNo.61abel.
Is that a Dogbowl c
Dean: Look, I don't know what
you have on the B-side of your
No. 6 single. Does it have some
weird shit on it? I really don't
know who that is. I'm surprised
you've got one, the test pressing came back like that. The
sticker on the front has the wrong
titles as well. It says "I Can't
Wait" but it's not. We got a
shipment of them back, and just
forthe hell of it I put one on my
turntable, and I didn' t know what
the hell it was. You think it's
Dogbowl?
Dogbowl released a 45 a month
after yours and the main title
was the same as the lyrics of
that song.
:ally   s
1   lot
Dogbowl though.
Well, I was convinced it was
you. I thought it was really
satirical and liberating. I
thought it might be a
collaboration amongst the
Shimmy-Disc people.
No, it was a mistake at the pressing plant. The next batch turned
outright. Id,
Ween and King
Missile.
Yeah, Ween are also on Elektra,
which really surprised me.
What's great about it is that
parts of it were recorded on a
Portastudio. So that's pretty cool
if Elektra are in to home recording. King Missile are on Atlantic, not Elektra. Kramer made
their record, and says it's really
good. He also just did a record
with Damon and Naomi called
More Sad Hits.
Kind of like a follow-up to the
Pierre Etoile songs. Were you
supposed to play on those recordings?
Well, in January of last year I
quit Galaxie 500, they sort of
talked meintostayingfora while.
They said they had some songs
they wanted to record, and I
there. On the
ecord we had a
lot of problems electrifying that song, but Fred
(the producer) insisted. I think
it turned out pretty good, con-
Thai's the song most critics
accuse you of slipping into
other genres with, ie. Thirteenth Floor Elevators-esque,
i the
intry-
Yeah, well, I don' t Usten to country music. There is some coun-
try-ness in the song but most of
it is filtered through Ustening to
other bands. In a way, I think
playing Ucks badly can be good
sometimes; you make them your
own somehow. I mean, I would
rather Usten to Pussy Galore
than Muddy Waters.
New York,
Coney Island has played a large
role in the inspiration of music.
It goes way back to "Coney Island Steeplechase" by the Velvet
Underground. What's the fascination surrounding amusement
There's a trend now of putting the
amusement parks out of the city
center so people have to drive to
them; they're shunted out of the
public focus. There's a guy I know
though, KimRancourt, from When
People Were Shorter and Lived by
the Water, who runs a club out
there on the pier called Side Shows
by the Seashore. I played there last
summer with Peter Kember from
Spacemen 3.
Some psuedo-guitar space-rock
It was really more of a goof-show.
He does diis thing where he tapes
' the keys of organs down and then
gets tlie guitars lo feedback. The
songs are long, nineteen or twenty
minutes, and, you know, it's pretty
hard to do diat and not come off
like an idiot. But for him its sort of
a science, I guess. But when you
see people sticking guitars in front
of amplifiers and going "Whooo.
Whooo," it's just odd.
His Spectrum si nil is a little more
song oriented than that.
Yeah, it's a great record, .same with
the Spiritualized one.
I guess that's a rare example of a
band breaking up and spawning
good side-projects...?
True, there's nodiing to be sad about
when that happens. Those two
records are both good, but different. The Spectrum one is sort of a
mind-trip thing, while the Spiritualized one if bigger sounding with
lots of orchestration.
Another band that's similar to
that, and also implicated within
the whole Coney Island thing, is
Mercury Rev...
They did die "Coney Island Cyclone " song, however none of them
are from New York, really. No one
in the States knows who they are,
except for maybe the music business people. I think they are making some really cool noise but I
don't know how they are going to
play live, considering their studio
stuff has lots of samples and found
Didn't their guitarist, Grasshopper, play on Lunapark?
Grasshopper played a handful of
shows with us and on the record a
bit. We always knew that he'd be
going back though.
Your record also makes reference to Coney Island, with its
"LunaPark" section inside.
A lot of amusement parks in the
past had Lunapark divisions. The
title also makes reference to the
amusement park in Sydney which
has a huge clown's mouth for an
entrance. I used to go there as a kid.
I once read a quote describing it
as representing the grotesque in
architecture, especially when held
against the splendor of the Opera
House across the bay.
Tlie Luna Park in Sydney is pretty
rundown and under the steel of die
harbor bridge. It burned down since
I left, as did die one at Coney Island.
There are a lot of parallels between
die parks; diere's a matching Coney
Island section at Luna Park, Sydney.
it for the record. The next one's
going to be called...um, Stanley.
Haa.
It seems that your record and
others, like the Mercury Rev
album, are giving the Eastern seaboard a distinct sound with elements of psychedelia and rhythm.
Another example, however not so
geographically east, is the new
Kendra Smith record...
I really liked diat record too.
That's also another example of a
band breaking up and doing good
solo stuff.
Yeah, I agree, the Mazzy Star record
is great. I figure bands are lucky if
they can make three records, so when

&**S__-_J« Fuck Hump, meet BUM: Victoria's
next big thing.
Kevin Lee, bassist;
Graham Watson, drummer;
Andrew Malloy, guitarist/semi-vocalist;
Rob Nessbitt, guitarist/vocalist
Bum formed diree years ago
but have only been playing
for two, as die first year was
spent practising. Tlieir name
is derived from rediscovering
that longtime favourite, po-
, childhood swear. "It was
thejoke diat went too far." All
of the members of Bum claim
tlieir musical roots to '80's
hard-core bands. Kevin was
1 the Infamous Scientists
/hile Graham was in
Nanaimo Mod groups theMix
and the Vandals.
Why is Bum so damn
special and wordiy of room in
this here "zine? Simply be-
;e they play loud, wicked,
pop-punk, slightly '60's tunes
it are gaining popularity
ickly. According to the
band, tliey'respecial because
they "try hard, diey don't take
themselves too seriously, and
mse they have that spe-
sex vibe." Enough said?
Bum has released five
now, 3 since Graham
joined the band  10 months
ago. Theirdebut7", "A Prom-
iseis a Promise," was released
by Lance Rock Records as was
"Debbiespeak."
' 'Debbiespeak,'' which features
Graham in the transition of
drummer, a position he has
since taken up permanently,
has done exceptionally well,
charting aU over the Northwest. Their second 7" was a
double for WayOut! Records
as part of the Blobs series. This
gem featured Scott Henderson
(of Shovlhed fame) alongside
Bum with Scott recording and
playing on the single.
Bum, more recently, has released 2 more 7"s that were
bodi recorded at Egg Studios
in Seattle and produced by Kurt
Bloch. The "Up the Well" and
"Pool Hall Richard" 7" for
Lucky Records is Bum's tribute to Keith Richards while
The Bum Go Crazy 7", for the
Australian Au-Go-Go label,
pays tribute to the Dictators
with a cover of "Weekend"
and a new original, "Your Disciple." Both of these singles are
predicted to do even better than
the "Debbiespeak" single.
As for touring, Bum has
gone on "mini-swings" around
Western Canada and the U.S.,
covering ground from Victoria
and Vancouver, through Bellingham to Seatde and back with
such folk as The Young Fresh
Fellows, Posies, Huevos
Rancheros, The Fastbacks, Girl
Trouble, Gas Huffer, the Rev.
Horton Heat, The Smugglers,
and Eastern Canada's rock
Gods, Sloan. Bum thought
playing with Sloan, "exceUent,
swell guys and a great band,"
was a good publicity show.
Once a month or so they play
their hometown of Victoria,
where "there are lots of good
bands but not many people into
them." Good bands Uke Pigment Vehicle, the Vinaigrettes,
Show Biz Giants, and Fracas.
Bum felt that the youth of Victoria were finally cluing into the
local scene at their last show in
Victoria when they played with
The      Smugglers
Rancheros and cub.
B um' s influences are "every
great rock' n' roll band ever, especially Triumph. We'rejustagreat
melting pot of influences...hope-
fuUy [we can] get to the point
where we can do Uiis for a living
and pay for rent, food, cat food,
and stuff like that, and never have
to work shitty jobs again, which
we aren' t doing now
anyways!"
You  can  be
of Bum in the fit-
promise. Check out
their show with The
Evaporators and The
Mr. T Experience
And take a Usten to
their debut CD,
Wanna Rock Sensation (Popllama/
Lance Rock), when
it's released in late
short-film
maker, is trying to clean up his
image. Widely known for being
one ofthe foremost pioneers of
the "Sick and Twisted" cartoon
genre, he says he's had enough
of catering to the tastes of those
who love to be disgusted. "I am
not proud of them. I, believe it
or not, have moral qualms about
making those, but my financial
backers prefer that I make them,"
he grumbles. "I can't even understand why people think
they're funny."
Not funny? Well, they are
gross. Deep Sympathy,the 'toon
about the church and
necrophilia, was hands down,
the sickest thing ever made.
But you had to chuckle at it,
either in actual bad humor or
it of rr
t ignora
eof
what humor actually is. How
could Mike have let himself
make such shorts as DeepSym-
pathyt Or, rather, how did he
come up with the idea for something so repulsive? "I remember seeing a Book of Lists in
which Ann Landers or "Deal
Abby" had their strangest letters. I remember reading how
one woman would submerge
herself in freezing water for twenty minutes   and   then
herhusband.
I thought that
from    that,
story of Deep Sympathy."
With other popular cartoons such as Quiet Please and
Sitting Pretty, the 'toons from
Barrelhouse Studios (B.S. Productions), it's easy to forget his
first plunge into the world of
cartoons, Beat. Beatwas a pleasant little sketch about a jazz
band who drive away the beat-
ni k crowd of a beatni k bar, but
manageto draw them back with
the help of the "mysterious saxophone player." Assisted by Rod
Filbrandt, of "Wombat" fame,
it was a cool and hip animated
Mike and Rod split over
the usual differences: "I was
tist back
then, and I liked it. Rod, on the
other hand, was a lot more
practical. He actually wanted
to get paid."
Mike Grimshaw has just
made a new 1 24 second short
called Stage Flight. It's about a
jester, Cranky, who has a performance before his king, a disagreeable lout who enjoys executing people. Understandably, Cranky is terrified, so to
bolster his spirits other people
take the liberty of force-feed-
ingandsnortingmassive quantities of drugs into him. When
he finally hits the stage, well...
ifyou can grass if the king
likes the performance or not.
It's not called Stage Flight for
nothing.
The problem with Stage
Flight is that, while definitely
beingdarkcomedy, it'snotsick
and twisted. It isn't like the
past gore-fests, it's tasteful and
funny, although very short.
Hence, this was completely
financed by Grimshaw
himself, at a loss to find any
financial backers. "I've just
gone through the toughest
fiscal yearof my life. Canada
is a dead end," claims Mike.
Tired of being the star-
soda with." One can just imagine the type of people who are
die-hard Quiet Please fans:
people you wouldn't dare give
BIC™ ballpointpenstobecause
they'd be lethal weapons in
their hands.
Integrity means a lot to
Mr. Grimshaw, that's why he's
ashamed ofthe sick and twisted
genre. He's proud of his other
work, such asa very short MTV
station identification. "I entered
a contest where MTV was looking for independent animators
fora station I.D., wherethe big
MTV logo would flash across
the screen. I didn't win and I
was very disappointed, but a
week later they called me up
and asked if they could buy it.
That was uplifting."
Grimshaw claims to have
been inspired more by Rocky and
Bullwinkle than anything made
by Hanna-Barbera, which only
caters to four year old toddlers
and to the Hanna-Barbera creators themselves. He does not have
a great passion for full-length
animated featurefilms, they're just
too long and it's hard to retain
integrity in that field. But animation itself, while being an art form,
is expensive, thu s integrity is often
sacrificed—$3000 a second may
be spent when creating even a
simple cartoon. And making one
without major financial support
requires tenacity and a serious
desire for quality animation.
And while everyone knows who
Mike is, you can't pay the bil Is with
hallowed words of fame. Does
Grimshaw have any words for
aspiring'toon makers? "Don't do it.
It's for starring artists." But art is art.
And Mike Grimshaw is trying to
make his cartoons into art again, art
he can be proud of.
APRIL   Q In Ihe beginning (actually, il was
1984), Dean and Gene were only
fourteen, and unto them appeared
the demon-god BOOGNISH. And
there was darkness upon theearth.
And BOOGNISH spake unto thee,
and made known the Way, "Let
there be Ween!" And there was
Ween. And, behold, it was good,
and the world was neverthesame.
Since that day, Dean and
Gene Ween have recorded many
hundreds of songs and released
three albums on three different
labels, each of them a twisted,
unexpected, irresistible, often hilarious, often incomprehensible,
mind-bending, time-stopping,
mixed-up, chemically-enhanced
collection ofin-jokes, bizarre food
obsessions, and classic rock fantasies filtered through the minds
of the two pot-soaked prophets
with the aid of the cheesiest of
drum machines and fbur-traek recording technology. Love it or
hate it, the music of Ween is like
nothing else.
Theirlatest LP, and also dieir
major label debul with Elektra/
Warner, Pure Guava. was recorded
entirely in an apart ment they shared
in a faun house in Solebury, Pennsylvania, from wliich Dean and
Gene have since been evicted.
Tou ri ilg in support of Pure Guava,
Ween visited the CiTR premises
and Dim order took the opportunity to speak with them in our
Discorder: How is the tour going so far?
Dean Ween: Well, so far we've
been cavity searched by the Canadian Customs pigs and we
haven't played a gig yel.
Why did they searchyou? Were
you acting suspicious?
Gene Ween: She was just a bored
woman. She was really bored.
Dean: I'd probably do the same
thing if I was a customs person.
What do you think you'd be
doing if it wasn't for Ween?
Dean: On the flight out I thought
about it. I think I'd like to be an
airline attendant.... A flight attendant, that would be a great
job: just walk the aisles. When
Ihe seatbelt sign goes on you can
walk around anyway.
102
Can you tell me something about
yourselves that I would have
never known unless you told me?
Dean: I have the biggest Thomas
Dolby collection that you've ever
seen. I have every Thomas Dolby
twelve-inch and single from his
first three records. Even the inde
pendent label stuff before he was
signed. I have so many alternate
mixes of "She Blinded Me With
Science" it would make you sick.
You never could have known unless I had told you. And I'm not
lyin'.
How about you, Gene?
Gene: I had a red-eared slider water turtle that lived longer than any
other red-eared slider water turtle
ever...about fifteen years. The average life span is about five to
Speaking of pets, I heard that
your cat Mandee ran away when
you moved. Have you found a
replacement?
How did you end up signing to
Warner/Elektra?
Gene:    My    father's    a    big
On your albums you ask fans to
bring you food when you come
to town. On Pure Guava you
specifically ask for hot meals
and no more junk food. What
are the best and worst things
you've ever gotten?
Gene: The best food was a leg of
Leg of lamb!?!?
Gene: Yeah, actually, we've had
Gene: I did. I got a cat.
Dean: What's its name?
Gene: Bosworth.
That's a good name. That's the
kind of name that, if that cat
dies, you can name the
next one Bosworth II and it'll
sound cool.
Gene: [pleased with the idea] Yeah,
you're right. He's a cool cat.
Dean: I got a dog.  Jim. Big Jim.
[see track 4 on Pure Guava.]
Do you still record at home?
Gene: Yeah, mostly. Or we go to
studios, sometimes as well. We
did a bunch of stuff in the studio
a lot of good food recendy. The
worst food is like gettin' a bag of
Cheerios or something. Abigbrown
bag of Cheerios.... People think
they're funny by givin' us, like, a
sausage-in-a-can and stuff like that.
Junk food.
Has anyone ever made you a
pork roll, egg and cheese? [the
title of a track on The Pod ]
Gene: Yeah! In Virginia a girl
made meaporkroll,eggandcheese.
It was cool. And it was good, too.
Do you have pork roll up here?
I'm not sure. Is it just a message?
Gene: No...it's kind of hard to explain.
Dean: It's a pork product.
I feel like I'm missing out.
Gene: Yeah, it's a Philadelphia thing. It's very Philadelphia.
WeU, is there anything you
want to say to the reading
Gene: Buy our records. Buy
ir records and make us rich,
Iw
Dean: [suddenly possessed?]
We piss on your face you big
losers. We think you suck and
I'll piss on you if I see you. I
piss in your mouth.
Gene: [laughing] C'mon, man!
Chill out. Shut your moudi.
He's gonna give you the flu,
You've got the flu?
Dean: Totally. I'm sick. I'm
gonna flip out. It's so contagious. I got it from, like, 80
people who had it.
Gene: [to me] You're gone,
man. [to Dean] If you got it
from your girlfriend or something it'd be different, unfortunately, you got it from
Pigface.... He was on tour with
Pigface so if I get the flu it's
gonna be because of Pigface.
I wonder if that's a particularly evil strain, the Pigface
In the past you've referred
to Ween as a gospel band
spreading the gospel of the
demon-god Boognish. In a
way, this makes sense of the
way people react to your
music. It's like religion,
people feel strongly about it.
Either they're totally into it
or they just completely cannot understand it: love or
hate, no middle ground.
Dean: That's the way it always is. That's the best way to
be. I'd be pretty upset if it
ever changed. There's never
middleof the road people with
Gene: Yeah, people love us or
they just absolutely think that
there's nothing redeeming
[about Ween] at all.
Dean: We get a lot of bad
And a lot of good ones.
Dean: Yeah, but never anything in between. That's the
Any final words toDiscorder
readers?
Dean: [possessed again] I shit

Change of Heart: the last indie band in
Canada? Probably not, bat one of the
toutfiest and most creative. Since thdr
inception eleven Tears ago, Change of
Heart have released a string of ambitious, land"ol albums, Including Flflj
Feet Up Slowdtnct, Soapbox and
I99_'s excellent Smffe. Their current
line-op featores Mike Armstrong on
percussion, Bernard Maiezzsa on kef-
boards and sampler, John Richardson
on drams, and founding members
Rob Taylor on bass and Ian Blorton
on gt_tar and vocals.
Discorder talked with Ian Blorton.
This is his story.
Dhoortttr. I f_M Ior every band that
has opened for yon and gone oo to be
sodoessftd there most be..
Ian:   thousands that didn't
So do yoo have a new album coming
oat?
No. We didn't have a drommer all of
last year so it made it hard to rehearse
and write. We write collectively. Oor
songs are aboot, well, being alive in
Canada, more or less, boring, and
environmental things from a firsthand perspective-being inspired by
certain things we see.
What are the influences on yoar
songwriting?
For Rob (chief lyricist) I think it's
books. Of coarse newspapers are a
wonderfol scarce of disinformation.
In terms of bands...Shadowy Men On
a Shadowy Planet with that ponk
rock ethic, "Be fair to everyone and
everyone will have a good time." I
really like Neil Young, though I don't
think everyone in the band does. Anyone can play gottar like Neil Young,
there's this attitode of "It's okay to
make mistakes." We listen lo everything: a lot of rap and mid '80' s SST
staff like the Minatemen and Meat
Poppets. People osed lo say we sounded
like the Meat Poppets all the time. I
saw them on their last toor and I was
surprised, it was the fourth time I'd
seen them and they were the best I'd
Change cf Heart seems to have fallen
through the cr-cks-not wacky enough
far college radio, too quirky for the
I think sometimes we fall through the
cracks but college radio has been totally supportive. We were *1 for the
entire year on OUT, the Ryerson station. Without college radio I don't
know what we'd be doing As for the
mainstream, well, bigger bands have
said they liked us and I think that's
helped a bit We're still very much an
10_££PigSEf?Jj£^
Are there any weird places Change of
Heart are popular, like some pocket of
ootback America or something?
No, we've only played America four
times. We do really well in Guelph,
Ontario, a really good town wtth some
good bands: King Cobb Steelie, Tank
Top. They have a lot of all-ages shows
there. There's a comic company there
too, called Tragedy Strikes, and a guy
who does this comic called Sin. We're
(hlnUng of asking htm (o do something for a t-shirt or cover.
You're a comics fan?
Oh, yeah. I mean. I don't really collect
them Cash [and being) a C_B_fc_
indie band (don't go hand In hand]
you know.
Sure. So what do yoa think of all
those busts going an to Toronto comic
Yeah, they grabbed some copies of
Yommy For. I don't agree with censorship at aH It's up to the individual
to be intelligent enough to make their
own decisions, even if that means
giving neo-Nazis freedom of speech.
Banning them just makes them more
Interesting to k_k
Right. Just listen to them, you'll see
how stupid they sound. The Body
Coont record was a terrible record in
my opinion, the controversy jusl
helped sell tt more; people were buying bad music
Any favourite Canadian bands at the
moment?
Eric's Trip out of Moncton. Superconductor. I've only heard one Kreviss
song, I thought it was pretty cool The
Lawn. Sloan.
Change of Heart sounds very Canadian to mt, to a good way..
Really? I'd be prood of that
Smfle was very ambitious. Did the CD
format cause yoa to reassess the way
you record or what you wanted to do?
Actually, tt was meant to be a double
album wtth four sides but it never
even made ii to vinyl
Is SmSt a concept album?
If you want to call tt that, that's a very
overblown term. We formulated ideas
about the world that were similar.
The title came from Brian Wilson's
album, SwSe , that was never released.
There's a monologue daring There
Yoa've Gone" that sounds like tt might
be from One Flew Over ihe Caddo's
NesL.
A gay in Portland puts out these compilations of found stuff, and one of
them had this guy who has been
confined lo a mental institute. II was
a note he sent to someone on cassette.
Speaking of Brian W_a_a what about
oat of Toronto? Not to mention any
names-
Barenaked Ladies? Moxy Frevous? Totally and completely harmless. It's a
Canadian tradition going back to ifcLon
& McLean and Bowser and Bke The
thing is, everyone in those bands is a
really great mosldan. E's not my cap of
tea. And the Barenaked Ladies helped
independent mast a lot, now you can go
into record stares and find indie stuff.
And that's because the Barenaked Ladies sold 90,000 copies of their tape
Even the SUmpoiers never sold 90,000 F

THE PIT PUB • IN THE BASEMENT OF THE STUDENT UNION BUILDING, 6138 SUB BLVD. • 604-822-6511 It's been a long time. Youth
Brigade stopped playing way
back in 1985, eight years ago.
Sure, Mark and Shawn continued along afterwards without
Adam as The Brigade, but it
just wasn't the same. Things
changed for certain, but for most
people The Brigade was never
really a suitable replacement.
Well, our prayers have been
answered! Youth Brigade are
back together with a furious new release entitled
Come Again, on their
own  label.   It's   been
they released Sound and
Fury but you'd never
know: sounding like tlie
Youth Brigade of yesterday but fresh and
new. It's a wild, tuneful, catchy sound they
have happening, let's
hope it stays that way.
Discorder interviewed Youth Brigade's
guilar. st/vocalist,
Shawn Stern, over the
telephone via theB.Y.O.
offices in L.A.. Here's
whal we talked about.   Re
Discorder: Youth Brigade are
back together. This is something that I definitely find exciting, but I'm sure there are
people wondering just why

hearsing and played a few show
in April and May. Actually, i
was during the week ofthe L.A.
riots. We had a bunch of shows
scheduled, strangely enough, as
"The Coming Back of Youth
Brigade" and the police were
doing what they normally do
here. So, we did some shows,
then went into the studio in J uly,
did some more shows on the
west coast in September, and
did a ten country tour
of    Eu-

think, it made me research, it
made me go out and think for
myself." That's the whole idea
of it, so we're accomplishing
something. If we are able to do
that then I think it's worthwhile.
I think you have to look at what
ally a personal thing when it comes
for six
weeks: 39 shows
in 45 days. It went
really well and people
seemed to really like the
new EP. People liked the
idea of it and seem to be
responding well so we'll
keep doing it as long as we can
have a good time at it.
That answered my next ques-
how long you see yourselves
doing this and what is going
to happen with That's It! and
Royal Crown
the matter is that I don't
it goes way beyond that. Art, in
general, is something that tries
to inspire people. I' ve got things
to say and people seem to be
interested in hearing about it,
that's great. I'm able to make a
living off of it and that's a wonderful thing; I don't have to go
off and do some job, working
for someone else and doing
something that I don't believe
As far as the popularity
thing goes there's been argu-
 aboutthis,
group of people
that's into them." Once the
band became popular with other
people and it's not hip to like
this band anymore, people abandon the band. What kind of fan
are they then, really?
We had the same sort of
thing happen in the early '80's,
especially here in LA., when
bands started getting popular
and the crowds started getting
better. I would notice the articles that would get written up
in the papers that were always
exploiting the violent part of
the scene. A lot of kids would
Do  you  notice any major differences    now    when
you' re playing and ten years
ago when Youth Brigade were
playing? What are some ofthe
differences you are seeing?
Well...it's really like comparing
apples and oranges. The scene in
those days was young and new
and had never really been done
before in this sense. I was also
young and just part of something
that was happening. We v
sitting there thinking "Wow! Tins
is really big!" We
;just doing it.
then and they
seem to like what we're making right now, so we figured
"why not?". We were one of
the first bands to ever do it, why
shouldn't we take advantage of
the popularity of it now?
I believe that it's all worth it
ifyou can have an influence
on at least one more person.
Do you think that the impact
of a lot ofthe important messages are being lost with the
something to say they want as
many people to hear about it as
possible. Ifyou can do that and
maintain the ideals that you are
trying to do this by... more power
to you. My philosophy is, like
you said, if I can inspire one
person to do something with
their life then I think I've accomplished something. It blows
me away when people say "I
liked this band until they got
popular, and now they are no
get into punk rock for the wrong
reasons. There wou Id be a lot of
jocks who would shave their
heads and get into it because
they loved to get in fights or be
aggressive. The fact is that for
whatever reason someone gets
into the music or the ideas. A
lot of people have said that "I
got into it for the wrong reasons
but then I listened to the music
and tlie ideas and it really had
an effect on me. It made me
like you could just
turn on MTV and see these bands,
or flick on the radio and hear this
music; college radio hadn't been
going on that long and public
radio was something that you
just sort of found out about. It
was very underground. To get
record stores because most stores
didn't carry tkem. It was all independent stuff, little labels that
no one had ever heard of and
little fanzines. No major maga-
s were really covering the
How do you respond to the
people who are against the old
bands reforming: Youth Brigade, SNFU, Articles of Faith... ?
No one has said anything to me,
most people have been really positive about it. Fear got back together and I, personally, don't
think they were ever really part of
the scene here in L.A.. They were
definitely a band that got together
for all the wrong reasons.
There was the attitude early
on in punk rock, when I
was in high school in the
late '70's, that "anyone
can do this." That was the
whole do-it-yourself attitude that developed out
of the original attitude of
anyone being able to get
on stage and "knock down
all the stars." Fear got into
it for those reasons but were
never part of the community as far as I' in concerned. They
didn't hang out; they had a real
elitist attitude. A year ago they
did a big show with the Toy Dolls
that was packed. That was definitely a reunion situation where
people were getting together to
try and make some money. That
seemed to be the only motivation. They didn't really have much
to say from the beginning and
they didn't get back together to
be a band and make a record.
I thinkthattheseotherbands
you referto are bands that worked
really hard for many years, had
tilings to say, paid their dues, loured
and got frustrated by the lack of
attention and goi ng nowhere. They
fell apart for different reasons
but, generally, because ofthe lack
of being able to make a living off
of it. Now, when the music seems
to be popular again, and they are
some of the bands that originated
this sound or were some of the
best bands doing it, and there seems
to be people interested in hearing
it they get back together. I think
it's a personal thing for each band.
My perspective is if people want
to hear it, and they are interested
in the music, then why not? No
one has come up to me and said
"you shouldn't have gotten back
together, you should let dead dogs
lie,"or anything. Oneortwopeople
said they were pretty unsure of it,
but after they saw us they said it
was great.
We're not trying to elicit a
bunch of nostalgia because that's
just not going to work. We have to
appeal to new kids and new fans.
There are old fans still out there
too, but a lot of them have grown
up, got families, got jobs, and don't
go to shows anymore. We'vegotto
proveourselveseveryday, wecan't
just go out there and live off of our
past reputation. It won't last long if
we try to do that.

© Regrettably, all of you who tried to read
the Negativland interview with Mark
Hosier last month, "Just Say No Dough
Pt I," ran into a major deciphering problem. That problem was the doub ling of a
column of text and, therefore, the omission of another—ah..computers, a won-
derful thing In a vain attempt to gain our
self respect back and to also dowse a few
flames in the Negativland camp, at a
time when not all press is good press,
we'll take-up from where we screwed
up last month. Discorder extends its
apologies for any confusion or anxiety
thismay havecausedand wenowresume
you to normal programm ing  hopefully.
We have, kind of indirectly. Someone
we know, who is a manager, has written
in a letter and got some answers, sort of
It seems that they 're still concerned with
the public perceiving them as being bad
guys in the situation. And that if we have
any creative ideas of how they could
help, that doesn't involve them lending
us money, ihen they might be interested.
I don't understand that. I believe I read
they grossed $96,000,000, or so, on their
tour, so I thought asking ihem to lend us
$20,000 was kind of like asking someone for a quarter for Ihe parking meter.
It's no big deal at lhat level. Who knows?
I'm sure there are certain reasoas for
Ihem not doing it; nasons Idon't understand because I'mnotacorporate rocker
One thing that we're actually hop
mg lo do is getI___dRecortLs to, at least
on paper, give us our record back ad
wm what we might call a pyrrhic victory. We won't get it back to release
legally, because Casey Kasem is still
hovering as a threat, but at least we'll
have finally turned the tables and beat
them Island is saying that they're open
to the idea but, oops, can't do it because
Casey's threatening to sue. I think that's
just a convenient out for them. They
don't want to give it back to usat all and
they've got a great excuse. The reason
('asey never said anything all along was
because he knew Island was doing a
very successful job of stomping the
record to smithereens. Plus it gave him
Ihe luxury of being able to publicly take
a sort of liberal nice guy point of view
when, in fact, he had nothing to worry
about 'cause the record is wiped out.
The big
Greg Ginn was t
fact, he has now filed > suit against
Negativland for copyright infringement,
amazingly enough. I don't know if the
irony escapes him or not, but he's vio-
laled the same copyright law wit
pulling out Ihe U2 single, and t
happily rums around to use the copy--;|
right law against us to stop us from
selling the niagazme. So he's suing us,
for copyright infringement, for reprinting his press releases and for reprinting
a credit report on how much SST is
actually worth. Since they were continually accusing us of being rich and making them oul to be poor, I decided to find
out if thai was really Irue. Well, I know
I'm poor, I know we all live below the
poverty level in Negativland, but il turns
oul that Greg is grossing literally millions in a year. I've got nolhing against
him doing that but it was kind of amazing that he was trying to paint this in
public, in this way.
So he's turning around and suing you
for...?
He's suing us and demanding a trial by
jury. Curiously enough, he wasn't willing to do anything to fight the Island
lawsuit; he wasn't willing to investigate the options of other ways it could
have been fought. But he is wUling to
spend $ 150,000 to take us to court. We
think that the suit against us is so silly
and weakly written that it's guided principally by anger. f ^M
Petty revenge? f ^^H
...and he just wants to kick our ass. I
think Greg assumes that since we don't
have any money or resources that we
would just have to roll over.
A friend of mine who is in a similar
situation and it's getting ridiculous,
but if you don't involve yourself in
the process you get screwed. But I
don't need to tell you that
We learned early on, with the original
lawsuit, that we should be intimately
involved. We should have followed our
instincts at (he time to pursue other
avenues to deal with Island, but we
were convinced by SST that there was
no other alternatives And since SST
had the mosl up-front liabilities it
seemed fair enough to let them handle
Anyway, once you're sued by
somebody you can t just ignore it A lot
of people have said, "Well, Mark, why
don't you just forget about it or throw it
in the trash, it's just a piece of paper?"
That was my feeling too, but Hound out
that when you're sued you're sucked
legal v«
sucked you in therewith Ihe dirt and the
lint and you can t get out You have to
respond to the rules of the system. If
you don't, the other side wins and get
what is called a "default judgement"
Then they would get everything they 're
demanding, and SST is demanding
$90,000 from us and our next two
records. ;
Presently, SST Is not paying us
any of the royalties from any of our
records, they're withholding all of that,
and they have also succeeded in stopping us from selling our magazine. The
magazine was doing quite well: we
were on our way to gaining the position
of being able to run our own label again
and putting out our next album. Luckily, we were able to sell out the first
pressing and pay off the people who we
borrowed money from, with ten percent
Whai's happening now is that
we've actually found free legal help.
It's not completely free but in the legal
world it's pretty close We pay phone
oxing costs—
I We actuaUy
firm, $400 an hour lawyers free, and, as
lawyers go, they seem very helpful in
getting together our case on how to respond to SST. But the idea that we've
been drawn into this, having to use the
same lawyers and the same system, we
find generally despicable. The American
legal system is clearly set up to be used
effectively by people who are rich and
powerful. If you're not rich, you don't
have any power and you lose. That can be
used very effectively as a form of censorship, which is exactly what has happened
to us. What SST has done to us is no more
or no less than censorship. The copyright
issues and the stuff [in the case] are basi-
cally, as Greg Ginn would say, a
"smokescreen." Really, he just wants us
to shut the fuck up!
We put out the book, on one hand,
trying to publicise some of Ihe dirty, icky
side of this lovely business called music,
and I think that we just have this fascina
tion for exposing thugs that aren't sup
posed to be exposed and that's always
fun But we were also frying to argue some
higb-falutlig ideas like the copyright law
what's wrong wilh it and what's wrong
and telling people who are creative what
they can or can't do. Though we were
under attack for one record, essentially we were under attack for our
entire way of working. We've been
making records using bits and pieces
of sounds from our media environment for about twelve years. The
book was kind of a form of self-
defence to try and argue this position from a creative standpoint, instead of a legal, managerial or corporate standpoint.
It seems that the ni usic ii
to be changed. It seems that it isbeing
run by a lot of washed-up artists,
dinosaurs and people who hare no
business being in music People all
over are facing a lot of problems with
trying to get their art out to the pub-
be. They have to go through thismessy
business and it usually screws up a lot
of things, a lot of good songs are getting unsung. Hopefully, as younger
people are getting into these bastions,
things will change—at least a little bit.
Now, because of the huge success of so-
called altemauvemusic, you've got major labefcrall over the independent music
worldlooking for the next band they can
siphon off. Ten years ago independent
labels were virtually ignored by the majors: they totally ignored college radio
and could care less about what was
going on with college radio.
every major label has a college
rad io rep. And if you look at
most college radio lists the
majors have succeeded really well.
and show you the figures in the cost of
making a record, and what we're going
to be making by selling the records
ourselves—and I wouldn't have any
problem ever doing it if you wanted to
know—we 're going to be making pretty
good money, eventually. Do you have
to try and do as good as you possibly can
and be as big as you can, or can you just
decide to say how much money is
enough?
Apparently, Ginn needs more and
more. I mean, Ginn started off with
Black Flag and it's kind of amazing
that he's turned into the mogul that
he is, considering what the ideas behind the band that got him the record
label were.
Yeah, and if those things concern you,
which they do me, I think it's a story to
pay attention to, because as you get
older, especially when you get into your
thirties or forties, you find that you just
don't know how hard things can get in
terms of surviving. It can be a lot easier
to have some kind of extreme high ideals about how you want to live your Bland what you want to do. And as you get
older it gets harder and harder to stick to
that, or in our case keep making record-
that are interesting and have some kind
of creative edge to them. I think that's
really important and really instructive
to pay attention too because it can happen to anybody, you turn into everything that you're against.
I've heard a lot of n
ter. Sooner or later a press release is
going to come out of SST, I don't know
about what but something is going to
come out attacking us in public. After
the way the whole story has evolved,
and the way Negativland has played it
out in public all along, Idon'tknow how
he thought he could sue us and expect us
not to fight him except in public. That's
all we could possibly do. It seems that
part ofthe reason he's suing us is to shut
us up, but by suing us it has the exact
opposite effect
Well, yeah, you fight back more when
you're on the ropes. If you did finally
shut up they'd forget about it If he
keeps poking at you, your going to
poke back the only way you can.
Well, we've found the legal help and, as
I was saying before, when you get drawn
into the legal system you have to respond. We're responding with a counterclaim. It's going from mud throwing,
to rock throwing and brick throwing,
pretty soon we'll be Molotov cocktail
throwing. Thereasonweresponded with
a counterclaim is because the lawyer
said, "Look, you want to try and get SST
off your back, you can't just deny their
allegations, you have to defend yourself
with a good offence" He was telling us,
among other things, to sue SST for libel,
for the "lying motherfucker" letter that
Greg put out We decided against that.
Good God, we don't want to be seen in
public as tell ing someone they can't say
something! I mean, I may not like it that
Greg put out that let-

back. That's what we're demanding in
the counterclaim, on top of not paying
us royalties, paying the wrong rate, mishandling this legal situation and releasing tracks of ours on compilations with-
SST has released countless
repackaging and greatest hits of a lot of
the bands that have left the label and, as
far as I know, none of the bands have
ever been consulted. We're on something called SST Acoustic, with a track
from Escape From Noise, "Nesbitt's
Lime Soda", It's a really funny collection, because every single artist on that
compilation really hates SST and has
been ripped offby them! Anyway, all of
those things constitute a gigantic breach
of contract That means the contract is
rescinded, which is to say it isn't valid.
Greg has forced the whole issue into court for reasons I don't know
. It's not to his advantage at all to play it
out in a technical, legal way. We were
trying all along to talk about it in an
ethical and moral way. In a way, when
you're in a courtroom, those things are
irrelevant It all has to do with points of
law and contract language, and in that
whole area, they're gonna lose. Hopefully, we'll actually get ourrecords back.
IMy feeling about their suit is that it's so
unreasonable and so emotionally motivated that I don't expect that he's going
to say, "oh, gee, okay, let's negotiate a
settlement." I fed he's going to dig in to
the bitter end, Kke a little boy who's

Most American station-
seem to be in the palm of
the majors now, which was not the
case in the early eighties when SST,
Homestead, and others were starting.
Itsecmsthat Canadian radio is avoiding the majors as a rule.
I'm sure Canada is not as important a
territory to m ajor corporate labels. They
may not push as hard. There could be
more psychological resistance because
we're Americans and you're Canadians
and there might be an innate resistance
to any giant American company pushing product down your throat.
That's true. The fact that bands get
stomped by large American companies just for being artists doesn't help
our opinion of them, at least of the

Now,     _^^B

^^ had pro
through
most of the last year, that
re not the only band that
problems with SST.
Oh no, Greg's suing the Meat Puppets in
a ridiculous lawsuit and he owes Sonic
Youth huge amounts of royalties.
They're in the process of negotiating
something, some kind of out of court
settlement, but there's a very large
amount of unpaid royalties to quite a
few bands. And there are other band-
that sort of inexplicably get paid their
royalties on time, just fine. It's really
inconsistent. I don't think it's a cut and
dry issue of who he has decided to rip
off, I think there's this really strange
psychology to the whole thing of who
he does and doesn't pay and why.
It's very strange because you hear
about some bands not getting a cent
for a long time, and other bands seem
■ to be having a continued relationship
Kith SST. There are some bands that

i of a free society, ifyou •

Ifyou did fight that as libel you'd be
in the same ring as be and Kasem
are, which doesn't help you.
Remember I was telling you how his
lawyer had not advised us of the conflict of interest? That's one tiling where
legally, in terms of the way the law
works and tlie codeof ediics of being a
lawyer, this guy screwed up in a very
big way TTiat's one way we can counterclaim There's other things we can
do that have nothing to do with the
case, for instance, one really strange
term in our contract says that this contract in, writing, constitutes the entire
contract and that any oral agreements
made don't count So, here's Greg attacking us and suing us,

A couple of really good things have      invalid, therefore they don't even have
happened since we put out the newslet-      the right to manufacture their own
for these
petty lawsuits, or at least
the ones that I find out about up here,
have something to do with the Y chromosome getting in the way of good
judgment
At least in the Island Records lawsuit
there was something grand about the
whole thing, horrible as it was, there
was something dynamic to the ridiculousness of it It was so perfect in a way
because it was U2. If it had been any
other band I don't think it would have
got the same kind of press, it wouldn't
have the same kind of resonance to it
Because it would have been expected?
Yeah, unfortunately the SST suit is just
petty and stupid. The idea that this is
going to drag on for two years is very
disturbing, and even if we 'win', we've
still lost We've already lost, listen to
me, all I'm talking to you about is all this
legal crap. It's consumed us. It's hard to
think straight about anything else.
But you are thinking straight, you
have been in the studio lately, right?
Since we paid off everybody that lent
us money for the magazine, a couple
of people have turned around and
said, "Oh, well, this is great. You've
paid us back quicker than you said
and we even got interest, so I'll lend
you even more money!" So, the new
release that was close to being done
for next fall entitled "Free", has seen
in the last couple of weeks, some
people come forward with money,
the graphics are almost finished, and
the mastering date arrive in a couple
wi< of weeks. So we're actually going to
get a new record out, hopefully, by
April.
Is that going to be on Seeland?
Yes, and we're going to do a short west
coasttouraswell. This isgoingtobethe
first time in our entire history that we' ve
actually had a record out around the
time we've played shows. We're so
unorganised as far as doing the kind of
things you're supposed to do in order to
have a career and make money doing
this...we've never really been on top of
it. We don't have a manger or any of
those things that people have, and don't
So what's the Free album gonna be
hke? Is it hke Helter Stupid with two
concepts running through the whole
thing, or will it be Uke Escape From
Noise"! Well, that had a concept, loo-
Here's a description: Negativland's new
record is Free, contains twelve cuts consisting of fifty-seven minutes of music,
found sound fragments, vocals, and noise
relating to: a well-known convenience
store chain, torture, the quality of urban
life, Cadillacs, firearms, the Bible, interstate trucking, geriatric discomforts, big
dogs, bicycle safety, alcohol consurrp-
tion, driving in circles, death, organ buttons, religious dialects, and the truth about
our national anthem. And U2 is never
mentioned. It's our big album about
America It's a whole lot of different
pieces that kind of started to gel around
the time the U.S. decided to invade Iraq.
We were all pretty upset about it, and
there was a number of things we were
working on previous to that which became inspired by the invasion. I hope the
people that have listened to all of our
other stuff, when they put it on, are really
surprised, or shocked, maybe be
appointed      or whatever,
Kasem, and if he sends you a form letter
back write him back. You see, the problem I have with Mr. Kasem is not that he's
taking that position, that's a very understandable, conservative corporate position he's taking, the problem is that he's
being hypocritical to what he said in public. Also, he himself has been arrested for
ist nuclear test-
He's an ethical guy.
He's got a liberal political agenda himself, and he's one ofthe few people in the
media who has marched against the U.S.
invasion of Iraq, which is very impressive. He clearly sees that there's a role in
the world we live in to do things that go
against the law if it happens to be wrong.
That sounds like something I heard him
say a while back!
You did?
It was very similar to that.
He needs to have some of those quotes
rubbed in his face. The funny thing about
this whole situation is that it's making us
hopelessly jaded and cynical; it has a
terrible effect on me. At the same time,
another part of me remains eternally hopeful that if I explain it to enough people
someone's going to go, "Oh, you're right,
I was being unreasonable, I'm sorry. Heh,
lemme fix that for you, I'll help!" The
problem is that they usually go, "Oh, whal
a sucker, let's take advantage of him even
U2, Island Records, Casey, and
Greg Ginn have been given ample opportunities to respond to well-written, well
thought out letters and reasonable offers.
If they're going to treat us this way, okay,
maybe we can't stop them, but the fact tfiat
they're even going to try to stop us telling
our story is terrifying. It's like, they're not
only going to step on us, but they're going
to step on us when we try and talk about
the fact that they stepped on us!

Are you going to doll up the release
Uke you did with A 10-8 Place or the
older stuff Uke the first album, which
included inserts, the handmade cover,
etc.?
Well, there's one little thing we're doing
that's kind of neat, it's kind of minor
actually, it's a little thing we are doing
with a sticker. We do keep the old records
in print, and we do make them with the
handmade covers. The video we put together by hand and it comes with parakeet feathers and little things in it. And
the magazine which we hope to do again,
once this whole thing is done, we'll put
out the new, bigger second edition. There
is so much work involved with the older
releases that the thought of doing more
releases like those is sort of daunting. I'd
like it if all of our records had interesting
hand-assembled packages, but there's
only a few people in the group and...

It's odd that a lot of the attacks and
hassles have come from people on the
ethical/liberal side—Uke SST which is
about hard-core punk rock, left wing,
ethical, our government sucks, you
shouldn't do this, type of ideology. The
same with U 2 and Kasem, all their politics are left of centre. And these people
are leaning on you as badly as if Bush or
Jesse Helms were stomping on you. So,
we can contact Kasem, we can fax you
and say you're great and everything,
give you an ego boost..?
Sure! And if you want to give Greg Ginn
a call, let him know how you feel, give
him a line. If you want to you can tell
people where they can order the U2 cassette. Send them $7, cash! Not Canadian
dollars, though!

jamtnin Just as I thought I wouldn't have
much to write about this month a
whole pile of new releases hit the
shelves—phew! First is Careless
Use of Knives (Invisible) from Bizarre Sex Trio. Yep, Martin Atkins
is the instigator of this and his cool
drumming is highlighted throughout this five-song EP. The featured
tracks, "StopSmoking" and "Avoid
Alcohol Sandals," are definitely that
but all the songs could' ve used more
of afocusorsomecutting. Thesongs
are a sort of noise soundscape but
are way too long.
Sweden's Cultivated
Bimbo, besides having a very stupid name, also have a new EP out,
Blasting In Progress (Energy). The
first track, "Ten Seconds to Crazy,"
surprised me with its techno-funk
style but still retained the cheesy
vocals I was expecting from Cultivated Bimbo. "Corruption," however, is an okay mix of guitar and
electronics with a bit of East Indian
vocals and sitar in the mix, reminding me of a Consolidated/Nine Inch
Nails hybrid. "Ice Blender" is high
on BPM and more to my liking.
Tilt's The Next Degeneration
(Danse Macabre) is bad news in a
major way; this release is ammunition for people who hate industrial
music. Starting off wilh the charming "Torso," about a man cutting up
his girlfriend because she "couldn't
believe in everlasting love," this is
totally overdone and about all that
needs to be said. Bad, bad, bad!
I've run across the Swedish
duo, Poupee Fabrik, on compilations before so I was interested in
hearing their latest CD, Crusader
(Energy), a kind of "best of release.
Poupee Fabrik is made up of Singe
Hen, Rik Bjork and Leif Holm, but
they could be anybody... even Nitzer
Ebb, with their slow homage to
necrophilia, 'Love You Dead."
There are some not bad sounding
songs on Crusader, like "Betrayal,"
but most fall into two of industrial
music's weak points: stereotypical
lyrics (death, hate, and dismemberment) and shouted vocals. This is
what makes a lot of bands generic
and creates problems for them in
finding their own sound.

The pair of lovers in "The Interim
Lovers" are used as a metaphor recalling recent events in that country
while "Zebulon," a ballad with the

recorders on the go. as well as some
interesting noise items such as a
metronome and the incorporation of

cymbal.
Saturday night's show was a
participatory event as messages or
noises could be left on Mark's answering machine to be used in tlie
night's proceedings. It'll be good to
see these guys perform by themselves because the other performance
put on by the Live Electronic Arts

was subject to the pretentious workings of Steve Gibson, Paul Dolden

Noble, tha nigga wit' mo' funk than
a bag o' skunk. Whut? Thee Album
(Chaos/Columbia) is Redman's debut release for which he gets plenty
of helpfrom Erick Sermon of EPMD
on the production end of things.
Man, this Redman guy is so absolutely insane fo' tha Parliament
samples that I think George Clinton
is gonna make more money off this
album than Redman! Redman is
basically about gettin' the blunt, the
mic and the funk, and he's straight.
s rhymes don't
as but he's definitely funked
in tha brain wit' his crazy, psycho'
ward delivery. If you wanna hear
some real thick funkjus' stick "Time
4 Sum Aksion," "Rated R," "Watch
Yo Nuggets", "Blow Your Mind" or
"Hardcore" in your earhole.
Yo, I finally got my hands on
Sista Souljah's non-Public Enemy debut, 360 Degrees of Power
(Epic/Sony). Sista Souljah is definitely pro-black message oriented
and all of the 13 songs here are
backin' it up. The title track, as far as
the beats go, is probably the most
hype, and believe me they do go
'cause this album was produced by
Eric "Street Element" Sadler and
the LG Experience. Chuck D guests
on "State of Accommodation; Why
Aren't You Angry" and Ice Cube
guests on "Killing Me Softly; Deadly
Code of Silence." On both tracks
Souljah gets blown away by the far
superior delivery of these seasoned
veterans; and they aren't arguing
with her hke on most male/female
rap tracks, they're supporting her. It
would have been better for Chuck D
and Ice Cube not to have appeared
on the album because their strength
takesaway fromSistaSouljah's own
On quite a few of the tracks,
like "Survival Handbook vs. Global
Extinction," Souljah doesn't rap but
ike Professor Griff did on his
first album, and it can be hard to
listen to. I mean, yo, cool the first
coupla times through but then when
you've got tha message there ain't
no funky rhymes to keep ya comin'
back fo' mo'. Here's a quote from
the liner notes which defines where
she's comin' from:
"Sista Souljah's album is dedicated
to the disregarded, uncelebrated,
unacknowledged, misrepresented
Black woman whose fighting spirit,
love, depth and compassion carried
all of us through the wicked corridors of white supremacy. To the
Black woman who has been raped
and ravaged by the European international thief, whose man only survives as a figment of the imagination of domination. To the Black
woman who is dedicated to love the
Black man in spite of white supremacy. All rise."

latest release yet. The Predator (Priority), for at least half of the album,
continues with the ground-breaking
hard-core beats that you ain't never
heard befo'...except, maybe, from
Das EFX, Cypress Hill or House of
Pain. It sounds like Cube has taken a
liking to this school of high-pitched
crazy sounds and scratchy record
loops. Kick in "When Will They
Shoot" and you're paralyzed 'cause
it's intense with "what tha hell is
that?" loops you ain't heard befo',
guaranteed. S ome of the instrumental/voice sample tracks coulda' used
a little mo' hip in their hop, but I
shouldn' t complain about thedowns
when Cube's kickin' "Gangsta's
Fairytale 2" and "Wicked."
Pipe-tokin' Cube is kickin'
street knowledge on most of the
tracks, gettin' busy on the payback
message, and dealin' wit' tha devil
on tha street level: "white man is
somethin' I tried to study, but I got
my hands bloody." Cube has taken
up the viewpoints of the Nation of
Islam and it sounds like he's become
a little bit over-paranoid of being
taken out by the government, judging by the number of times he brings
itup.Cube'sstilldissin' tha bitches,
although a lot less, and he's finally
comin' through on his bet to make
his only responsibility that of put tin'
out funky records.
Yo, Pass me the gat, F m gonna
fight back, Iain'trollin' over on my
motherfuckin' back! Yea, Brand
Nubian are fightin' back wit their
new release, In God We Trust
(Elektra). Now this is one dope release! Ain't no sellout in sight here,
Brand Nubian are kickin' tha knowledge like you wouldn't believe: still
keepin' tha beats simple, fresh, funky
and phat. This is a release which will
be blowin' a few woofers, no doubt,
and have ya riffin' on its freshness.
Checkout "TheTravel Jam," "Black
Star Line" with Red Foxx and, of
course, the immense bass boomin'
"Punks Jump Up To Get Beat

And there's more, yet! Tung
Twista, who you might know from
his "Mista Tung Twista" 12", is
Runnin' OffAtDaMouth (BMG)on
his debut record. This brotha is due
for a mention in tha Guinness Book
of World Records for his speed, if he
isn't in there are already! I must
admit it took me a few listens to
unnerstand every word he's sayin',
but most of tha tracks don't match
tha crazy speed that he was kickin'
on his first single. I'dliketoseeifhe
can pull it off Uve, yo! Tung Twista
doesn't go into any uncharted water
with his topics go or beats, both just
holdin' up tha status quo in rap,
meaning that if it wasn't for tha
Twista'sreggae-rollin', lyrical style
rhymes, this album would be quickly
forgotten. You'vegottabe way ahead
of the status quo in tha rap game to
be considered up to snuff 'cause the
competition is intense and tha new
shit is already old tha next month.
If you're down with the Geto
Boys you'll want to check out two
new releases from (former ?) members Bushwick Bill and Wille D.
Bushwick's album, Little Big Man
(Rap-A-Lot), sees thangs from the
crazy-ass viewpoint of everybody' s
hero: the Little Big Man wit' tha
dirty mouth. He's still throwin' down
lyrics in his psycho style with one
eye on the American government,
one eye on the KKK and one eye on
any big-ass bitch in sight. Check out
"Ever So Clear" for the harrowing
story of how he got his eye shot out.
For beats he's got himself one
wicked-ass combination of hardcore, mega-bass, break beats from a
hve band kickin' funk guitar, bass
and old-school organ.
Wille D, on the other hand, is
Goin' OutLikaSoldier(Rap-A-hot)
and provin', just like Bill, thathe can
make it on his own. D's album is
more intense than bass-heavy
Bushwick's and he's morehard-core
in most of his messages, but he also
kicks up some funk like on "Pass
The Piote." Y'all had better be on
these dope-ass nigga's sides 'cause
you sure as hell wouldn't want to go
up against them, check!
Something else you might
want to check out is the Words From
theFrontlines: Speeches by Malcolm
X(BMG) CD with over 70 minutes
of exerpts from the speeches of
Malcolm X. Seeing the movie is
OK and reading the biography is
better, but if you really want to understand the man then listen to his
plan as he said it live and direct.

A mighty fine layout with
Gee-zuz catches your eye with
each issue. Lois of type on getting
drunk and listening to records or
going lo shows, reflecting a lot of
die editor's life but not challenging
tlie intellect. An increase of outside
submissions is noticeable since issue #1, with more opinions and
personal insights. However, I dare
the editors to print an issue with just
naked, muscle-bound men rather

Now, as far as I'm concerned,
printing a 'zine is one thing that
merits respect. I'll grant Havoc
diat but I Uli nk there is alot of room
foi inipioveuient. Too many wasted
pages (read wasted trees) for information and opinions that (if the
type is shrunk on a photocopier,
found at any of the numerous print
shops around Vancouver, for mere
pennies)couldother-wisebeprinted
on one double-sided page. It would
also be more cost efficient (read
cheaper) for the editor (Lucifer) to

Before I enterinto the misery
of demo reviews the only 'zine I
really have to add to Kim's list is
The World According To
Wozzle. This features diary entries from Wozzle that have to be
read to be appreciated. One slightly
oddball human being's wanderings
through the misery of the school
years, it's either very funny or very
depressing, ora bit of both. Speaking of misery...
STEPPIN' ON GRANT
I never really liked the Smugglers
and their brand of smarmy, '60's
cheeze but their At Germany 7" is
mances. That is it's catchy and also
has a harder garage-punk edge to it.
With this style of music energy is
the key and this 7" has some of that.
MISERY IS SUCH SWEET
SORROW
The Alien Gin tape I received had
thelookof late-'70's, bad boy rock
'n' roll written all over it but it
didn't quite provide as the slab of
cheeze I'd hoped. Mellow rock

All I can say about the Garden of Earthly Delights' (P.O.
Box 4963, V.M.B.O., Vancouver,

tunes that fall completely flat. Thank

to expect from the Bol Weevils'
Chaos Is Perfection tape (Swell
Productions, 1074 East 10th Ave.,
Vancouver, B.C., V5T 2B5) so the
rhythmic, electronic noise grabbed
my attention. Eventually, it just receded into faceless background
noise. There are still some fairly
inspired bits, especially the distorted
guitar noise on the "This isswell..."
track
The closest I can get to describing Naked Vibe (P.O. Box
4584, Station main, Vancouver,
B.C., V6B 4A1) would be somewhat heavy rock i n a mellow groove,
which meanders around various jazz
and '70's classic rock influences.
Totally pointless and boring.
Sinners Squad are yet another band that play "original" rock
V roll, daring enough to be called
alternative and yet slick enough to
have mainstream appeal. Tlus stuff
is played better than most but I
sincerely wish it was played far
So   >
.■ant   ;
people to get a hold of your band's
matenal without having to play Nirvana covers? Well, Jason Kolins
(18678-80lh Ave., Surrey, B.C.
V4N 3G5) is putting together a
Vancouver hard-core compilation
tape and fanzine, so if your band
would like lo participate, just give
Jason a shout. I'm not sure what it
will be called or when it's due out,
but with more contributions it will
come out a lot quicker. Jason also
passed on to me the new Fatal
Hatred demo, a deadi/grindcore
band from Cloverdaie. Let's just
say that I keep my death-nielal past
a secret—I wouldn't call it a phase,
just something that doesn't interest
me as much as it used to. Fatal
Hatred rip in with heavy riffs that
make me go "ya!" until the obhga-
tory throat gargling muffled vocals
and 100 MPH tempo change charge-
in. I'm unsure of the lyrics though
"jesus was along-hair, satan shaved
his head" has got to be the coolest d-
metal lyric in the past while. If you
hke d-metal, Slayer guitar solos
and all, get this. (6857-188th St.,
Cloverdaie, B.C. V3S5M1)
Seamen also have a demo
and, as the name suggests, sexist/
silly lyrics prevail. Call me uptight
but I'm sure these guys are intelligent enough to write more thought-
provoking lyrics. Maybe if you
know the Seamen you'll find this
more amusing. They're recording
again soon so we'll see what that
turns out like. (Contact 18678-80th
Ave., Surrey, B.C. V4N 3G5)
A long overdue demo has
just been released by local faves
Ten Feet Tall. Recorded at Profile Studios, the sound quality is
great and the cover looks cool too.
Now performing as a three-piece,
diese guys churn out fun punk a la
Adrenalin OD. and the Angry Samoans but with the pop sounds of
Big Drill Car or the Chemical
People. Yup, add a lot of Chemical
People. Lyrics on wastedfutures(?),
rednecks, skateboarding, nuclear
families and, sadly, tits, ass and
beer. (22459-132 Ave., Maple
Ridge, B.C. V2X 7E7)
Fatal Hatred, Seamen, Ten
Feet Tall and many, many others
will be performing in Cloverdaie
for a benefit to raise awareness of
Jesse Cadman's murder by a group
of teenage "gangstas" last October.
Jesse was the drummer for Seamen
and will be greatly missed in the
Vancouver hard-core scene, hopefully his death won't be forgotten in
yesterdays news—youth violence
is on the rise and effects us all.

Phone: 322-8924 Have you heard the latest, kids? The
maj ors are entering the minors! That' s
right, major labels have now taken a
second look at vinyl, particularly the
7" format and have decided to reinvest their corporate mega-dollars
into the system once again. Noted as
the "format that refused to die," majors will now start to release 7" singles
in the now-typical indie format: picture covers, colored vinyl, monthly
clubs, limited editions et al. Pathetic,
loathsome, offensive, but true.
An example of major flirtation
with a minor comes from Sub-Pop's
new, all-Maritime-Canada, double 7",
Never mind the Molluscs. Featuring
Sloan, Jale, Eric's Trip, and Idee du
Nord, just watch this one shoot to the
top of every college radio station in
Canada But after listening to this
packet's four sides I've come to the
utterly frightening conspired conclusion that this may all be the same
band! Or maybe they all just know
and love each other (or Sonic Youth)
in that isolated, only- in-the-maritimes,
inbred type of way...
This is the first time I've ever
heard Sloan, and their tune "Pillow
Fight" is pretty good in a Clearasil-
clean, college-safe, kinda way. It's
that melodic, messy, pop-jangle stuff
where the girl/boy vocalscompliment.
Jale's all-female Sloan sound
fairs much better here than on their
debut 7". And guess what? It's an
alternative, '90's, hizzy, eclectic pop
song!
Eric's Trip do two songs here,
the first being a quiet, whisper-sung,
banjo ballad which bursts intc.an
alternative, '90's, fuzzy, eclectic pop
song!
Finally, the obviously French-
Canadian, Idee Du Nord, who sing
half in French and half in English, are
the only band which slightly stick
out, simply because ofthe crazy-assed
conga drums rattling through the
whole song. But on the whole
it's...guess what? (Sub-Pop, P.O. Box
20645, Seattle, WA 98102)
It seems this column is getting
to the point where it's all about the
vibrant scene in the Maritimes and
Japan but, hey, where it's happenin' I
shall document. And let me tell you,
friends, for some reasonit'shappenin'
in Japan. Estrus Records have recently released their second 7" comic
book entitled Tales From Estrus featuring the Nippon garage talent of
Supersnazz, The American Soul Spiders, Jackie and the Cedrics and The
Beyonds. Supersnazz and The
American Soul Spiders rip
through a couple of rock 'n' roll classics, "Teenage Head" and "Satisfaction "respectively, while Jackie and
his Cedrics play trash-o-phonic
style to their "Stompin"' instrumental on the flip-side. And the best ofthe
bunch, The Beyonds, go crazy with
a wild punk sound much like the
Rezillos, all the while (as you'll read
in the accompanying comic book)
battling a giant crab attacking Tokyo.
Very greal, too bad the sound quality
is so poor. (Estrus, P.O. Box 2125,
Bellingham, WA 98227)
So where were Japan's all-geisha 5,6,7,8's when Tales... was being contrived? These chicks could
whip the collective Japanese asses of
all of tlie above artists with tlieir new
killer single "Edie Is A Sweet Candy.''
Wild rock 'n' roll is what it is, baby!
(Rockville, 180 W 28, RM 501, NY
NY, 10001, USA)
Hey, if your 7" plays at 33 rpm
put that on the label, for Christ'ssake!
The Nuthing did not do that and I
thought I was listening to the fucking
Chipmunks. Back on 33 Tlie Nuthins,
from l-'ngland, are an above average
dose of R'n'B '60's rave-up. Pretty
good for a nuthin band. (Merry-Go-
Round Records, Flat One, 347
Queenstown Rd.. London, SW8 4LH
UK).
Th,s next single came out
months ago. but my friend Bryce just
lent it to me, and I gotta mention it.
It's Redd Kross' amazing7"onthe
Seminal Twang label of England.
Redd Kross are still full speed ahead
on their current pure pop direction
and this record proves that they really
know what they're doing. "Trance"
and "Byrds And Fleas" are two excellent, loud, full, huge, '70's-style pop
songs. Let's dance. (No address)
I picked up the latest Bob magazine from Delaware and with it came
aone-sided flexi featuring unplugged,
acoustic numbers from The Flaming
Lips and The Lemonheads. This is
the first ti me I' ve heard either of these
now fairly famous bands and, even
though these are obviously outtakes
and demos, neither band did anything
for me. The Flaming Lips' "Life On
Mars" is a slow, bizarre, folky tune
with scratchy vocals sounding like
they're coming out of a distant transistor radio. And it shouldjustbeThe
Lemonhead as tins is just lead Lemon
Evan Dando and his acoustic guitar
playing a boring song. (The Bob, P.O.
Box 7223, Wilmington, DE, 19803,
USA)
Tim Kerr Records of Oregon
havereleasedasinglefromPortland's
solo folk artist Gus Van Sant.
Quirky, new age folk/rock a la
Jonathan Richman...worth a listen.
(T/K, P.O. Box 42483, Portland, OR,
97242, USA)
The ratio of all-girl bands compared lo guy bands is increasing so
rapidly that I'm going to stop mentioning il. but New York's Friggs
are indeed female and can rock out
'60's frat-rock style real well. The A-
side, "Shake," is not Ihe Otis Redding
classic but may soon rival Otis' number as to who shakes harder. The B-
side, "Wild Love," is reminiscent of
Ihe "White Rabbif'-era Jefferson Air-
i, this i<
way
moregroovy. And, hey, it'sproduced
by Ben Vaughn (Sympathy For The
Record Industry).
Mod alert! Oh, wait, false alarm.
The Waking Hours have made an
attempt at tlie ever-cool, Mod, power-
pop sound but flirt a little too closely
with Morrissey to be considered hip
or even listenable. Look, ifyou fuckers
want to be worthy of the Mod Title,
leam to rock first. How the hell did
this top 40 crap get on 7" vinyl?
I've been hearing a lot of hype
about The New Bomb Turks out
of Ohio as some sort of new rock 'n'
roil band to tame all others, but was
frankly disappointed by their mid-
tempo Mudhoney-esque A-side,
"Weak." However, I quickly became
a disciple of tlie hype and the Turks
after being wowed by tlie B-side's
"Summer Romance:" a super fast,
wild, smashing rock 'n' roll song.
Why wasn't this the A-side? The New
Bomb Turks are not the best thing to
ever be spat out ofthe pipe but they' re
pretty damned ferocious and worth
tracking down. (Get Hip, P.O. Box
666, Camonsburg, PA, 15317, USA)
Finally one I almost forgot
about, another 7" from Halifax's Cinnamon Toast Records, Bubai Skull's
four song EP Index. This rather well
produced and fine sounding band are
your basic, wildly flamboyant, punk
rock and roll act. It gets a little funky
sometimes (a no-no) but they tend to
stick to the straight-out rock. Reminds
rjie of Toronto's Supreme Bagg
Team., or, maybe, a grungy B-52's?
Nah... (Cinnamon Toast Records,
8464 Rohie St.. Halifax, NS, B3K
4N1).

Cruel Elephant
Deemed "New Wave Night" at die
Elephant by the poster and "Anti-
Climax Rock" by a friend of mine
111 a! k i u I.ii ice, I cleverly divided the
show into two categories: the first
two bands fell into the Beat Group
and ihe last twointodieCoreGroup.
Hey, I know what you're thinking,
"Who does this guy think he is,
pigeon-holing our music when we
don't need to be pigeon-holed?"
The answer is simple: Don't play
music Uiat has the opportunity to
be. Not saying that all these band-
were bad, in fact, they were quite
the opposite. I'm guilty, you're
guilty, bands are gudty of doing
this, but until we run out of snappy
monickers for the sounds of Vancouver's up '_' coming combos,
we'll all have to grin and bear it,
OK?
That notwithstanding, Meet
Daisy were already up 'n' rocking
by die time I passed through the
Cruel gates, the last few notes of
"Little Zebras" piercing the air as I
clambered die steps up to the slage
area. These guys are definitely my
favourite new act, as I've enjoyed
every set I've seen them play. On
stage Uiey' re pretty low profile, but
they make up for diat with incredible vocal harmonies and songs to
boot. The looped sound byte be-
also. It gets nd of dial space where
a song ends and the routine of try-
kill time by telling a joke
while y<
r guita
d. Tins
-latterboys these
guys ain't. What they are is deserved of attention and a spot in the
Steel Pole Bathtub/Slint camp.
Slackcrbeat I shall declare thus.
Blaise Pascal, despite some
technical imps, played a decent set
of quiet guitar-buzz frequently
woken by crashing drum shudders...I'm getting used to the vocals, too. Hopefully they can refine
the fluidity oftheir show in time for
their opening slot for Superchunk.
Oh, yeah, Slackerbeat all die way!
Bellingham, WA's Crayon
squeezed out whal was to be a very
short set. The cool thing about them
was that they didn't sound anytlii ng
like I've heard on vinyl, although I
did recognize one song from die
Moominland EP. These guys have
spawned what I'd like to call "Brat-
core," defined by nasally sung tunes
and accompanied by speedy
rhythms—you'veheardit here first!
Finally, cub's cuddle-core
stylings nabbed them top spot on
the bill. Quiteafew new songs were
displayed for the enthusiastic
cubsters, including "Electric Chair,"
"The Cheese," written by and performed by (a rare appearance) drummer Valeria, "A Picnic," spotlighting Robynn's new guitar sound
(Fuzz!) and "Hello Kitty," the fastest cub song to date. Candy was
tossed and an encore of "Motel 6"
was delivered, what more could we
ask for? A great performance and
great show as well. Oh, feel free to
use my handy nametags next time
you see or mention any of these
bands. If you don't, well, trying
calling cub Canada's Shonen Knife
and you'll get a guitar neck jabbed
in yer ribs...it's up to you, friend.

Inspiral Carpets
Commodore Ballroom
Friday, February 26th
Ever since my Mom enrolled me in
piano lessons as a kid I've been a
sucker for good keyboards. So, al -
though I'm not afan ofthe Inspiral
Carpets I wanted to check out diei r
liveshow. Unfortunately, I couldn't
fi nd a good spot where I could hang
back and play Joe-Cool-concert-
reviewer until I noticed a large
table behind the sound board. Reserved. So I sat there. The opening
act was a techno-dance ensemble:
full drum set, guitars, bass, keyboards, D..L, sexy singer, and a
dancer. I was admiring how well
they were pulling it off when from
my vantage point behind die sound
board, I noticed diat die only tiling
hve was the singer. Typical. In between bands four middle-aged couples show up for their reserved table. I kindly moveoverand ask one
of die lucky fellows what's up with
the special treatment. Turns out it's
the parents ofthe Inspiral Carpets.
"It's amazing how the Mer
sey sound has taken off again," he
tells me in his quirky accent.
"Well, the kids just eat it up
don't they?" I reply. I just couldn't
believe that this band, no matter
how bubblegum they are, actually
brought their parents on tour with
them. "Do you live in Vancouver?"
I ask.
"Hey, take it easy camper, I
don't giveautographs!" English arrogance at its best. I don't even like
his son's band and he Uii nks I want
his autograph. Prick. The band
themselves played a short set that
seemed long. No one is as happy as
die band is on stage, and no one
deserves to be. I did enjoy the light
show and, yes, 1 also dug the keyboards. Everyone has a guilty pleas-

Jr. Gone Wild
Town Pump
Saturday, March 6th
Most fans of original, live music
who lived in Edmonton during the
mid to late eighties probably have
some fond memories of drinking
Druniinond brew on tap at the Ritz
Diner wliile watching Jr. Gone
Wild. Hardly any good touring
bands paid visit to theCity of Champions so we were content with
homegrown bands hke SNFU, Idyl
Tea, Cadillac of Worms, Kentucky
Church Bus and, of course, Jr. Gone
Wild. It becameasadfactthat many
musicians left Edmonton forgreener
pastures (anything's greener than
the tundra of Edmonton), but JGW
stayed true to their Alberta roots.
And this was evident on the second
night oftheir two dates at the Town
Pump when a giant Alberta flag
was used as a stage back-drop.
However, the band that took to the
stage in front of that wasn't the
great drinking band of years past,
but a slick, two-steppin' unit playing a batch of Ian Tyson-influenced
donned in cowboy boots and the
occasional Stetson hat, appeared to
be having a grand ol' ti me. I desperately tried to accept their exploring
of new realms in music, however, a
friend told me that their new album,
Pull the Goa/ie, sounds entirely like
this. I felt old and conservative; I
wanted the Jr. of Less Art, More
Pop.
During dieir second set they
even turned up the amps a bit as
diey performed recognizable versions of some older material, at
which point dieir music reached
sufficient tempo to get the line dancers off the floor. Remember, kids,
country music is an alternative to

Saturday, March 6th
Commodore Ballroom
The Lunachicks opened and
ripped through dieir stuff widi
the kind of attitude best

ers pronouncement. "We' re
on the road and we're i
die rag!!" Next up wet
die Hanson Brodiers. Ai
diis point in the eveiung
rmthinkiiig, "Shit, man,
I would've paid the
ticket price for just
these two bands!" I
mean, if the Lunachicks or the
Hanson Brodiers couldn't get you
going then you better retire yourself to Don Ho 8-tracks and quit
taking up space at diese shows.
These guys were not only visually
stunning-(rubber bands on Uieir
glasses and Jason goalie masks) but
they do adamn fine Ramones cover,
not to mention their own material
which is fuelled with fast, punk-
rock guitar. Did I forget to mention
the hockey night dieme? Okay , I
The last time I saw Jr. Gone
Wild was just after keyboardist Ford
Pier defected to Roots Round Up
and guitarist Steve Loree left to
form Deadbeat Backbone. Although founding members Mike
McDonald (not the guy from the
Doobie Brothers) and Dove were
still in the band, the addition of a
fiddler and a slide guitar player
hinted at a progression towards foi k
or country. Well, it appears the latter route was chosen because the Jr.
that played at die Pump (minus the
fiddler) did just about everything
short of playing "Achy Breaky
Heart." However, the audience,
don't care for the sport myself, but
they did hand out some gnarly litde
"team" cards, featuring the different bands (not altogether worthless), and they played some crummy
hockey fli ck between sets (blech!).
SNFU and DOA did aboul
what you would expect (when will
they retire???) so it would be pointless for me to rehash it here again.
Frankly, I tliink both bands were
sounding a little lo tired in conipan-
son to die'Chicks and the Hansons,
but by this time so was I. Still, Thei r
stuff was good and this was for sure
a punk-fest not lo be passed up.
Guinness Gurl
Mystery Machine took to the
stageafullhourafter the announced
show time and were greeted by a
confused young man with a nose
ring who singularly rushed the stage
and later told them that they sounded
like Dinosaur Jr.. (Acute observation, bud, Dinosaurplayscanip-
you guys have school tomorrow?"
By 1:00 AM the crowd had diminished to half and continued to halve
after each song. So by the time the
band finished their set at 1:20 the
only people left were Cell, the door
guy, myself, and the guy I was
givi ng alift. I considered approaching the band for a litde chat, or
something, but they looked tired
and, besides, I had to be at school
the next moming.
Lung CD Release Party
Station Street Theatre
Saturday, March 20th
Starting later than I expected, the
great opening contrast artist, Tim
Racine, and his acoustic guitarwere
given a fair reception, as he played
degree of ei
heart. The theatre-style of watching performers sucks
hen     people
these guys.) Two
things became apparent as soon
as they started playing: l)ourparty
was sitting way too close to the
speakers; and 2) die sound mix was
really shitty. Widi the vocals and
drums hidden too deep in the mix,
good songs like "Shaky Ground'
and "I nvitation," which rely on sub-
Ue tone and effects changes as much
as they do on melody, were particularly hurt. And with the exception
of Shane, the stripping bassist, die
band's energy level stayed low until they ripped into a hyper version
of their instrumental "Ride."
Mystery Machine ended dieir
set with what I believe was a version of "Stain Master" that was
dedicat ed to this rag'seditor, Paul t.
Brooks. The band's lead-guitarist
wore a Buffalo Tom t-shirt reminding me that these guys sounded a
hell of a lot better when they opened
for that band last May.
Cell plugged in shortly after
with a slightly better sound, but
with a vocal demonstration so
strained thai Tom Waits would be
jealous. I wondered where die nose
ring guy was when diey played
"Dug Deep" 'cause there's a tune
diat sounds Dinosaur Jr.-like. The
band played more Uian just thesongs
off of their album, Slo*Blo, but
from what I recogiuzed, die songs
"Wild" and "Stratosphere" didn't
translate well live. They didn't let
loose widi any particularly inspiring guitar solos but they proved
dieniselvestobecapable musicians,
especially sincediey could juinpup
and down wliileunleashing torrents
of feedback.
About halfway through the
set one ofthe singers addressed the
rather young crowd with "Don't
Facepuller had it
goingforthemthis
light: tight, loud
and raunchy in all
die right places with-
Facepuller are a band that dominates on album and creates their
energy directly into their music. I
find them to be one of the better
bands to come out of the Vancouver scene. As for Lung, they come
on with a purpose in mind. As I
understood later, they also don't
like too play to late either. Supposedly, they had four operung bands
and had to cut some of diem because of the late start of the gig
(midnight], thus the foundation for
the Grant Lawrence quote, "Lung
are fucked!"
Live, Lung come together
with a full sound which you
could swear incorporates more
guitars than there are. As usual,
some idiot in the audience
wanted to hear the inevitable
7" single, "Litany," shouting
at the band after every song to
play it...so they refused. The
music generated a pit of average proportions without stage-
diving and the screens and people on the mattress onstage
were intriguing, but not terribly original. Ending the
evening, though, a TV massacre in the deconstructive I'm -
showing-what-I-can-wreck
portion of the show gave my
for our Industrial household.
Lung gave us great music and
devouring. SEE THIS BAND!

Earth 2
(Sub-Pop)
One song in 3 parts, 75 minutes, no
drums, no vocals, just two guys
(Dylan Carlson and Dave Harwell)
overdubbing 16 guitar tracks at
various speeds and tunings. Heavy
metal riffs slowed down tohalf speed
accompanied by layers of droning
guitar with enough bass for good
measure. It is deep and extremely
heavy. In fact, Earth are so
excruciatingly slow that they have
been accused of making their Sub-
Pop label-mates, Codeine, sound
like speed metal. This is no
exaggeration, Earth is definitely not
music for the masses. Asatestimony
to this just go check out the racks in
your local used CD store. If you find
that you just don't seem to have
enough time in your days, go pick
this one up, listen to it regularly, and
is long.
Earth haven't simply made n
they have managed to put together
seventy-five minutes of mood.

The Lyres
happy now...
(Taang!)
When I first bought the Lyres On
Fyre LP back in 1987 (recorded in
1983), I hadn't yet realized the implications of owing a record that
would throughout my years get
slapped on my turntable and, with
every listen, still sound as new as the
day I got it. This kind of quality
cist in many records and
for a band like the Lyres, who have
been around for some 14 years (not
including die pre-Lyres outfit known
as DMZ, who out-rocked just about
everybody in existence), I believe
they have trul y earned the title of (he
Last Bastions of Rock 'n' Roll.
This was probably not an easy
thing for die Lyres to accomplish
considering the fact that one man
stood out and shookBoston and the
rest of the world by the neck, screaming "Fuck you, I'm the king!" time
and time again until we listened.. .that
man was Jeff Conolly. Earning the
nickname "Mono Man" for his single-handed attempt to manipulate
everyone who had ever been in the
Lyres to his way of thinking (His
epitaph will probably read something like: "A team effort is everyone doing what I tell them"),
his unmistakable knack for
not knowing when to quit
(drinkin', ego-inflatin', and
rockin') and his earth-shattering voice and keyboard
playing make him shine like
some kind of heavenly light
from above. I mean, what
else can you say about a guy
who, while during a Lyres
hiatus back in  1989-90,
worked as a custodian at
N.A.S.A., yet still schemed
to put the band he had back
together after a tour fhat had
every member signing con
tracts with God-knows-who to have
him killed?
So getting the band back together is just what he did. Coinci-
dentally, the line-up on happy now...
is nearly the same as On Fyre, another testament to the Mono Man's
charm and constant pursuit of garage-rock supremacy. And if such is
the case, this line-up of Paul Murphy
(drums), Richard Carmel (guitar),
Rick Coraccio (bass). Jack Hickey
(harmonica) and the Mono Man will
certainly give them a leg up over
others vying for said title.
happy now... is 12 songs of
unabashed, manic, heartfelt garagerock that'll plaster ya to the walls.
And if I may lift a quote from a
review of the On Fyre LP I kept for
prosperity inside its cover: "...Although only [2] of the LP's [12]
tracks are originals, this doesn't
lessen its appeal one bit." In fact, the
covers that the Lyres chose are so
obscure, I would challenge Victoria's Got's-Punk Historian, Amazing Larry, to cough up the origins of
these nuggets. Anyway, the renditions of the Isley Brothers' "Nobody
But Me," with its unforgettable sing-
along chorus and "I Can Tell" by
Mr. BoDiddley.givenagoodorgan
transplant (no pun intended), are
indeed distinguishable. Other notable tracks are the Conolly-penned "I
Ain't Going Nowhere," with its
paint-peeling guitar leads, "Baby (I
Still Need Your Loving),"
showcasing Jeff's raspy vocals and
screeching organ, and "Stoned,"
backed by a rough-and-tumble blues
This was a long-awaited release for me (as they just reformed
last year) but it was well worth the
wait. And I think the album's title
can justifiably sum up mine and
Mono Man's feelings as we are both

Bestkissersintheworld
Puddin'
(MCA)
Witnessing the course of music and
its theses through the annals of time
it's pretty safe to say that sexual and
emotional trauma between the sexes
ranks pretty high in the polls;
classical (chastity), blues (STDs),
soul (monogamy), country
(bigamy), new-wave (virginity),
British pop (celibacy) and pop
(adultery) have all laid heavy hands
in the fate dealt to those who find/
found themselves i n.. .arelationship.
But the Bestkissersintheworld are
calling everybody's bluff!
Quite a few years ago, on
the Southern California coast, the
groundwork was laid for a musical
genre that would speak volumes to
hormone-bursting youth for
generations to come: emo-core! The
ingredients were simple: the musical
aggression of hard-core, the true-
to-life emotional songwritings of
tainted love/desire, and riffs, riffs,
riffs! However, somewhere along
the line the recipe was lost and bands
were then forced to rely on memory
to whip up Iheir own batch of
Puddin'. Not having the

MOFO'S PSYCHOSONIC PIX
Hi, everybody! I won't
prattle on too much because I am in
the gripof an extremely heinous flu,
leaving me weak and sore, etc.. Anyway, it's time to tell you all about
Mofo's Psychosonic Psampler Vol.
Two. Once again, yours truly has
compiled some truly odd and rare
tracks from some of the strangest
and/or most excruciating LPs I've
26 _
found to date. Everything from celebrities' bad attempts at a music
career, bizarre children's songs,
training records, and those wacky
religious fanatics! Those who have
purchased Volume One will testify
to the ulter strangeness of these collections, and how great, funny, and/
or what a big waste of time they are!
Of course, Volume One is still avail
able and you adventurous types can
get both tapes for a special price!
You'll notice the prices differ, this is
due to the postal kafuffle I ranted
about last month. If you include a
few stamps, drop the price accordingly (you Americans are going to
have to include IRCs to offset costs;
we can't use your stamps!). As with
Vol. One, each tape includes secret
songs to mystify you and personalize the tape. Here's the scoop on the
prices 'n' address:
Psychosonic Psampler Volume One
— features Bobby Sherman, The
Odd Couple, The Frivolous Five,
and 11 other pieces of weirdness.
$5.00
Psychosonic PsamplerVolumeTwo
— It's a secret. Selections mentioned from the last few months,
plus surprises!
$6.00
Both Volumes — Wotta deal!
$10.00

actually, the reason words can't describe it is because the person who

Puddin' is a fine EP—
much like Speedwagon's
High In-Fidelity was a great
LP—but missing from the
mixture are those simply
contrived riffs possessing that

attraction. However, even that
can be overlooked because
that's all that is missing. Ever
present is the puberty-fuelled
emotion, rage, indifference
and  desire that  only  a

psychological pain could
speak; anthems for disaffected
lovers around the world. And in
conjunction with all this, or in spite
of it, isn't it reassuring that in these
times of microwave-ready cultures,
and the pop icons to correspond
with them, the BKITW can put
everything in perspective simply by
saying, "I took the heat for cryin'.

FLOWERHEAD
...ka-BLOOM
(Zoo/BMG)
I had just got off my flight to Los
Angeles, mildly buzzed on cola,
m&m's and altitude withdrawal; the
night sky burned with the fire of
urban sprawl as I looked out the
airport windows. Shadows of palm
trees swayed nearby as I peeled off
my jacket to acquaint my skin with
the smothering heat. Well worn
suitcases fell like drops of
diminishing water onto the thirsty,
growling carousel. But when I
stooped to pick up my bag, from out
of nowhere, a figure clad in a red
cape snagged my belonging and was
off.

Book of Safety (HB)
Hanna-Barbera trots out Daws Butler, The Flintstones' cast (all but
Fred), and other voice stars to program your kids with nice, neat, little
rhyming couplets on the joys of
safety. Each segment is timed to the
average toddler's attention span:
about a minute. Butler is king of this
one. giving great versions of Quick
Draw McGraw, Yogi Bear, Augie
Doggie, Snagglepuss, and lesser

be traumatized and confused upon
hearing safety tips from creatures
who spend their days hitting each
other with frying pans, jamming dynamite up their keysters, dropping
boulders and generally maiming
each other.

*Live — Strawberry Shortcake
(Kid Stuff)
Yeah, sure, many big laffs can be
had listening to this sped-up voice (a
la Chipmunks) sing-a-long—stuff
like "Celebration" and "Strawberry
Rap" flee Cube it ain't!)—but the
coolest thing about this LP is who
are doing the voices. If you drag Lightning flashed and thunder
roared, suddenly before me was the
panther himself, the creature of song
from side one, Snagglepuss. With a
wink of the eye his pinkpaws carried
him into hot pursuit of the villain.
Snagglepuss, farsupenor in strength,
quickly nabbed the crook and
tortured him with a dousing in duty
freeperfumes and charges of ostrich
leather purses to the en minal's credit
card. My bag safely returned,
Snagglepuss taught me that
Flowerhead's ...ka-BLOOMis more
than just great music: I learned how
to use it as an effective tomato
chopping tool, weapon and food
dehydrator. Truly a great expenence
that even Disneyland paled in
comparison to.
So, you see, I could have just
written about musical reasons for
purchasing Flowerhead but now you
know it's a must have for any luggage
carrying traveller.

Million Seller
(Zoo/BMG)
Here we have a band that hails from
Swansea, Wales (just like
Badfinger) too concerned with being
pop-rock icons for their own good.
Million Seller is a collection of
thirteen songs which remind you
that' 70' s A. M. radio produced some
great music. The album is overproduced, highly unoriginal, but
completely necessary in these days
when alternative is just way too
cool. The Pooh Sticks' main man,
Hue Pooh, claims that his band is
"not weird enough for the alternative
crowd and too weird for the Top 40
crowd," but this shouldn't be a
problem to the band because anyone
that has ever been a teenager is
going to like this album (although
only one in five will admit it). As far
your finger across the label (or drop
your pitch control) while it plays, so
that it slows down slightly, you can
hear none other than former Zappa
collaborators Mark Volman and
Howard Kaylan (aka Flo & Eddie)
playing the title character!!! I kid
you not! I was tipped off to this
nugget by Andy, who works at Collectors Book and Records. He told
yours truly that they worked on the
records but were kept in the dark as
to what exactly the finished product
was going to be. I'm certain that it's
them doing vocals simply because
I' ve seen 200 Motels at least as many
times and heard the Live at the
Fillmore LP about 500 times! Get
out your old Turtle's LPs and dare to
compare!!!!

This record is way too intricate for

as the familiarity of the songs go,
Hue simply explains, "We don't
subconsciously rip things off, we
consciously rip them off."
Ahhh.. pop music: innocent,
derivative, and cheesy. You just
can't get enough but, for the time
being, Million Se/iershould be able

Not In Kansas Anymore
(Imago/BMG)
DIGABLE PLANETS
Reachin'(A New Refutation
of Time and Space)
(Pendulum/Elektra)
I tell you, people, words cannot
describe how tough of a listen these
albums are! They bring new
definition to long-winded and
hopelessly boring! The Digable
Planets are from the jazzy-rap genre
that those annoying fucks PM Dawn
have started, with a decidedly
mammoth nod to Arrested
Development. Digable Planets seem
to have this thing for bugs (two of
the three members are named
Butterfly and Ladybug), ambiguity,
goofy titles and, on top of that, the
spacey content oftheir throws makes
them flakier with each song.
Basehead album doesn't come off
much better. Theirlast work, 1992s
Play  With  Toys, got kind of
monotonous after the first few songs,
but if you looked at it in the context
of a concept album, it kinda made
sense.      Basehead's      jazzy-
coffeehouse-beatnik grooves are
okay in small doses but, as with
Digable Planets, you pretty
much   want   to   slaughter
anything within reach three or
four tunes in. Basehead has
great potential, but Ivey should
vary his grooves a bit more

POND
(Sub-Pop)
Ten is a number that is readily
associated with fulfilment,
satisfaction andapproval. In the
case of the new Pond CD, the
number ten just couldn't satisfy.
No, much to the chagrin of this little
numeral, a frequent sponsor of
Sesame Street episodes, ten songs
weren' t enough—anyone who hears
this CD will become an instant Pond
fan and long for more. In spite ofthe
lack  of frogs,  water  striders,
mosquito larvae, bug maggots, and
the cement shoe wearing deceased,
Pond's music shines like a beacon of
sunshine through a brine filled haze.
Their music is moody, focused and
intelligent enough to hopefully gain
the recognition they deserve in this
swamp of emerging bands.
Although their sounds could
feasibly be compared to early TJ2 or
Soul Asylum, they sustain a high
level of originality. Listening to Pond
makes me want to sing along and
run around., .that'sagood thing. Pond
shall rest and spin happily on my
laser endowed player, much like our
precious water skimmers in the
marshy ecosystem.

My favorite song is "The Cannibal

in the context ofthe eating of human

•   Never Mind the Molluscs	
In their never-ending search for the new hot rock scene, the UK
and US music press have found it in the Canadian maritimes. It
was up to the intrepid Sub-Pop Records to bring it to the
masses, to consume and decide of there really is life north ofthe
49th parallel and east of Montreal From this was spawned a
four-song EP featuring future stars Sloan. Jale. Eric's Trip, and
Idee du Nord. Remeber those names... there will be a pop quiz.
Eric's Trip ( 7.98c
®  Peter a___
From the fertile musical hotbed of Moncton. New Brunswick
comes the ragged guitar-pop of Eric's Trip. This is their second
release, the first being a limited edition and is the second
release on Murder Records (the first being Sloan's Peppermint
EP). Having just signed to Sub-Pop. "the Trip" could be the next
Me Mom and Morgentaler   ( 8 yQ(
®  Shiva Space Machine      ^-—
The hot sound of 1993 seems to hearken back to the sounds of
1980 when the Specials, the Selector, and Madness were filling
dancehalls. With the updated ska sounds of the Mighty Mighty
Basstones and Toronto's King Aparatus plus this new release
from Montreal's irreverent Me Mom and Morgentaler. it seems
that good ska will never die.
Velocity Girl /U.98
®   Copacetic V9^f3c
Imagine My Bloody Valentine with huge pop hooks, or the
Sundays rocking out Maybe this isn't an apt description of
Velocity Giri but they do fuse two sides of American and British
pop trends—full-on noise mixed with sweet melodies. You
know it's a classic mix — sweet and sour, yin and yang....

Shadowy Men on a afJ^dX
Shadowy Planet ( 8.98cass )
®   Sport Fishin' ^~ y
The Men ve back with their third long-player, this om produced by
the incorrigible Steve Albini. aid boy are we ever happy. No one
nowhere, no-how does instrumental music with as much energy
and style (sorry Yanni). The trae seems to imply that this album
would sound best sitting on a riverbank. rod in hand, with a cooler
full of sarspariu- at your side. We knew that's pretty difficult for us
city-dwellers, so just pass the sarsparilla.
GumbaU rjggj
®   Super Tasty x-»-__—y
Although the name Gumball is probably unfamiliar to most
people outside of hip indie-rock circles, this record is one that
might be worth risking your hred-eamed cash on. Firstly. Don
Fleming and Jay Spiegel have played with such notables as
Foetus. Half Japanese. Dinosaur Jr. Bail, and most recently the
Dim Stars with Richard Hell and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth.
Don Fleming produced the Screaming Trees' and Teenage
Fanclub's most recent albums. And finally, their last album.
"Special Kiss" rocked our world in the summer of '91. (It's so
new that we haven't had a chance to listen to it yet but we
figured that if we dropped enough names...)
Pavement    ™ a^_^
®   Westing (By Musket and Sextant)
Before the release ofthe excellent "Slanted and Enchanted" album,
there were three EPs released by Pavement which are now very
difficult to find. This CD compiles those years of lo-fi madness, along
with other hard-to-find demos aid compilation tracks.
