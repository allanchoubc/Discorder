Dear Discorder,
Hello, I'm the host of Beaver
Country, the only Canadian Music
show in Los Angeles, at KSCR
104.7 FM (USC College radio). I
play indie, alternative & roots
music from across Canada, and
I'm always looking for more material. If you know of any bands
that might be interested in getting
L.A. airplay, they can reach me at
830 Childsway, Suite 716, Los
Angeles, CA. 90089
Brian Adams need not apply.
Thanks for being groovy,
Tom "Big Joe Muflaraw"
Dear Discorder,
In response to Wendy
Young's letter regarding facts
about Cub and her two word description of said band ("They
suck!"). I can only assume that
Wendy leads a somewhat shallow
and sorry life. And it's because of
this that I can only feel sorry for
her. Such letters wreak of jealousy
and when written with a such lack
of literate flair I can only think of
someone who maybe lacks any
sort of a vocabulary in which to
truly express one's self. Come on
Wendy, tell us what you really
think, quit beating around the bush.
While I admit that Cub's act may
not be for everyone and that's
what's great about this world
Wendy, one cannot deny their
popularity at this moment. They
have sold thousands of records,
which is more than you or me.
They have held audiences in the
palm of their collective hands at
the second stage at the Canada
Day celebration at Thunderbird
Stadium as well as a highly entertaining show recently at the Commodore Ballroom opening for
Shadowy Men.
It seems to me that far too
many people are trying far too
hard to figure this whole Cub thing
out. What's to figure out? A portion of the world's population,
don't worry Wendy, it's a small
one (people in Australia haven't
heard of Cub) happen to enjoy
Cub for what they are, FUN. And
hey, Wendy wouldn't it be wacky
if we could all get a little more fun
in our otherwise boring lives, then
agains maybe you' re working on a
cure for cancer or solving world
peace and have all the fun you can
As far as Discorder being a
propaganda machine for Cub, their
popularity in Calgary, Toronto or
New York has little if nothing to
do with Discorder magazine. Discorder could only ever hope to be
that powerful, leave the popularity propaganda to Spin or Rolling
Stone, they've pretty much sewn
that one up tight. So Discorder
writes and article on Cub, so what?
Haven't they also written about
Kreviss, Superconductor,
Facepuller and a host of other local bands and isn't that what a
local rag should concentrate on -
local musicians. Maybe you'd prefer another article on Ministry, Nirvana or Porno for Pyros, Wendy.
So look Wendy, you don't
like Cub, that's fine, lost of people
don't like you but they're not writing in to tell the world about it.
The success of Cub really has noth-
ing to do with you and why you
wasted a stamp to say only a few
pointless words makes me wonder
even more as to your motives for
sending the letter in the first place.
Wendy, go get your own guitar
and start your own band and I
promise not to say you suck.
Really.
Garnet Harry
Well put, Garnet. But before other
nasty letters start pouring into
Airhead complaining or complementing Cub, there are afew things
which need to be written first.
Airhead will not be the forum for a
monthly barrage of insults, cross-
insults,  cross-cross-insults and
death threats involving either local bands or authors, Airhead is
the sole domain of insulting us.
Now, Wendy King did make
an allegation in her article which
was true: that is the members of
Cub and Discorder have been
known to frequent some ofthe same
drinking establishments together,
where in fact it is not uncommon to
find a Mr. Garnet Harry, the King
of Kitsilano.
However, this nefarious association does not invalidate the
fact that Cub is among Vancouver's most popular bands, (indeed,
in the month of August alone, they
played over forty shows and before approximately 120,000 people). And it is this popularity which
promptedDiscoider to acknowledge their achievements, and not
any "incestuous" liaisons.  .
And as to our running an
Airhead letter from one of our columnists, while it is unusual and
should not be done on a regular
basis, Garnet's letter did strike
home a very important point;
namely, that the readers of Discorder should not be able to embrace every band for which we run
an article. Hell, not even the eve rly-
eclectic Mofo can honestly make
this claim.
We here at Discorder only
strive for one thing, understanding; actually make that two things,
community and understanding;
well actually, make that three
things, we strive for community,
understanding and, of course, family values.

-(.(mW* this going on the radio?"
â– "Nope."
"You promise?"
"Yep."
So begins my afternoon chat
with Dave Baker, the voice of
Mercury Rev. The guy selling
their t-shirts assured me that Dave
liked to do interviews, but that I
should be prepared for a Uttle
weirdness. This really didn't come
as any surprise considering the
music this New York combo
cranks out: beautiful flute melodies,explosive guitars, madman
vocals and a sound thicker than
that stuff you used to make paper
mache piggy banks with in kindergarten. But I'm not worried, I
can deal with weirdness.
"It's not Uke we're against
selUng a million records. Who's
against that? It's all a matter of
thinking. When we started get-
ti ng successful, as far as popularity and sales goes, was when we
weren't thinking about it. It'sUke
the whole thing about getting a
giri: when you're dating and you're
ing some shit, weird stuff, not
really for anybody but ourselves.
We were stealing stuff, you know,
equipment. Using things we could
find like TV'sand making some
noise. Just having these fun sessions. Then we started making
some tapes and this label from
England, Mint, askedif they could
put it out. We started to get more
complex, using 24-track studios,
but we weren't putting anything
specific together to get label interest, the labels came to us.
"We're not stupid, but at
the same ti me we' ve neverthought
of our stuff as something to sell,
it's just been what we want to do.
They say 'you want to do this on
a bigger level?' and wesay 'sure.'
"We' re just lucky that people give a shit about our stuff.
Then again, I always figured that
with billion s of people i n the world,
there's got to be a lot of people
that Uke you. Chances are, right?
Look at the variables.
"There's got to be at least a
thousand people that Uke you.
"Anyone should be able ta sell
athausandrecords But I never
figured we'd be tap forty in
Englmdjnwmwliatthefuch?
That makes no sense."
too eager, the girl doesn't give a
shit. But when you don't give a
shit and you just be yourself, it
ends up that the girls come: and
you know when it rains, it pours.
So we'redbingourstuff, not thinking about making any money at
it, and all of a sudden these labels
start saying you guys are great
blah blah blah and we get hooked
up. We' re not part of any movement or scene. We don't even
Uve in the same town; it's not
hke we're even a band."
Claiming not to be a band
seems Uke a convenient way to
dog criticisms and fan expectations, and when on stage Mercury Rev are a confusing entity.
Jonathan Donahue and Grasshopper play their guitars into their
amps, their backs fully turned to
the audience. They are joined in
this position by Dave Fridmann
and his bass, while Suzanne
Thorpe weaves her flute Unes
about the stage as if oblivious to
the other members of the band.
Jimmy Chambers, a dead ringer
for Al Pacino circa Scarface, holds
it together with strong rhythms.
As for Baker, he's off to the side
ofthe stage appearing as if he's
trying to decide whether he's in
the band or part ofthe audience,
shrugging his shoulders at the
crowd, spewing out his rambUngs
(oftentimes incoherently) and generally looking about as the audi-
Baker and the other members of Mercury Rev, however,
manage to puU off a great Uve
experience that dissolves into
chaos and leaves you wondering
how it all began in the first place.
"We were sitting around do-
Anyone should be able to sell a
thousand records. But I neverfig-
ured we'd be top forty in England, I mean what the fuck? That
No sense indeed. Sharing
chart positions with milUon-seU-
ers and dead rockers is not exactly where one would expect to
find Mercury Rev's first full
length, Yer selfIs Steam. Described
as "the Butthole Surfers reading
Pink Floyd", the album lacked
anything close to a single other
than the Dean Wareham- su ng "Car
Wash Hair," which is buried at
the end of the CD a la Nirvana.
Both Yerselfls Steam and their
new release, Boces, were produced by the band and engineered
by Fridmann. Lighter, yet as atypical as their first release, Boces
denied the label's request for a
lead off single and, instead, produced two songs over ten min-
"Do you have anythi ng against
pop?"
'Tot?"
'Pop music."
"Not pot. Wedon' t have anything against pot."
'Pop music. You know what
I'm saying?"
"No. Nobody has anything
against pop music. Hiked the Beatles.
They were pop."
"Do y ou think that bei ng on a
major label could ever hamper the
way that Mercury Rev creates
"The only thi ng that they said
we couldn't do in the contract was
make a children's album, and I
think we're working on that.
"Forthemost part, I'd say our
band would be making music regardless of whether we had the
money of a major label behind us or
not. We might not be touring, but
we'd be making some tapes and
doing shit. It could have been film.
We do a lot of films: videos and
stuff. It could have been those that
made us popular."
I tried to get some more information about these films and
videos but David skirted the issue
and just told me that Donahue did
all the album art. I started to lose
out to the sun as David became
agitated by the heat. Fearing that
the interview would soon be over,
I switch subjects quickly:
"How do you approach the
studio? Do you rehearse?"
"No, we don't rehearse songs.
That's the funniest thing: we all
agree, it's making music. Having
fun Uke that is a good thing. It's a
different process, it's hard to be-
Ueve, but there's a lot of rules."
I'm a Uttle confused about
this rule thing, but still concerned
about the death of this conversation I try to breath new Ufe into it
by inquiring about how they prepare for their Uve shows.
"We were going to rehearse
for this Lollapalooza thing but
our drummer had chicken pox so
we didn't get around to it."
"Then when was the last ti me
you   played together before to-
now. If you start valuing the
money thing you end up nowhere. If you value having a
good time, at the time, and make
stuff that challenges your mind
oremotions, you do better. What
good is it ifyou make a million
dollars by the time you are sixty,
then die the next day? You've
basically fucked your life."
The heat and sun are becoming a problem so we move
into the band's tent, which they
are sharing with some jugglers
and Tool (one of today's most
appropriately-named bands).
David introduces me to the rest
ofthe band. Tool is outside using their portable weight set, an
added perk that Jonathan claims
will be theirs: "it's all just a
matter of time." I'm offered a
drink from their cooler, filled
with pop. I grab one, noticing
that Tool's is full of imported
beer. Baker motions over to the
Tool guys, "You see, that would
be a new thing to do. Lift weights.
Why not?" Cooling off, the interview continues.
"I'm not saying live for
today, but going 'this year I'm
in grade six, then I'm in college, then I got two kids, then
I'm doingthis, then that...' lifestyle has been mapped out by
people that are dead. We' re doing
what we want to do. We're not
mapping out our careers, we're
mapping out our lives. We're
doing alright, but people still

day's show?"
"Thelast tour. Wedid a mini
tour with Dinosaur Jr."
Still confused about his rule
thing, I questioned him about it:
"Rock is supposed to be tbe
thing where rules are broken. But
it ends up that a lot ofthe time you
break one rule and people go,
'Whoah! You're fucking brilliant!
You have too many ideas!'
"There's this attitude that
dictates that ifyou Uke one band,
you should like them for twenty
years; it all moves so slow. That's
why it's referred to as Dinosaur
Rock.
"We're weren't hearing what
we wanted to hear on the radio, so
we decided to make it ourselves.
There's a lot of people Uke that.
"You know who was like
that and didn't give a shit? Rappers. They were going, 'It'shope-
less, we don't give a shit! We're
down on the bottom, let's do
something'. They ended up doing * ^mething creative because
they weren't afraid of blowing
"With us, we're not afraid
of blowing it because we know
a lot of great jazz and blues
musicians that are on welfare
ask us what will happen when
we meet with success. We've
already got success, we' ve made
a record. We're successful because we got to make it. To us
power is doing what you want
to do, so we're doing what we
want, making a bunch of noise."
The conversation started
slipping into smaU talk and complaints about the heat, so I finished my soda, shook some
hands, and blazed out into the
Lollapalooza heat. I don't think
Dave noticed me leave because
he and the rest ofthe band were
too taken in by some juggler
doing stretches in front of a
I bumped into Dave later
on that day while Mascis and
company were rocking the
crowd. We spent a few minutes
watching the show together in
silence, exchanging a few brief
words before heading oursepa-
"I like that song. That's
pop, right?"
"Yep."
"Nothing wrong with that."

awd, our first interview...we
were just so nervous...I took
about six pisses within the span
of an hour as we paced nervously awaiting the arrival of
the much heralded Wool.
Well it had been about
three hours and Wool's van
By: Sean
Casey, Kip
Sprungman,
Jeff Dinnon
and Jason
James
still hadn't showed up. It probably would have been more
comfortable to wait inside 86th Street Music Hall, but we
weren't all that welcome there. Fumbling nervously with a
recorder wasn't such a good idea during House of Pain's sound
check. Our amateurish shenanigans got the attention of Danny
Boy and the promoter resulting in our being booted from the
Hall.
Our only hope was to head off Wool before they got
inside. Our pride, our manhood, and our first Discorder assignment were at stake. We had to get this interview or die trying.
A beat up blue van shaking violently, and almost on the
verge of a stall, screeched to a halt several hundred meters past
86th Street. Backing up the wrong way through four lanes of
traffic isn't highly recommended but, nevertheless, in staggered Wool.
Not even giving them enough time to breath, we fell
before Peter Stahl (vocalist, guitarist) and passionately pleaded
our case. He was more than accommodating. Under his tutelage we were once again welcome inside the 'Hall'. Letting the
recorder run we chatted freely.
Discorder: How has the tour      How do you prepare for a
been so far?
Peter Stahl: Pretty good,we did
Portland last night and then we
came up to Vancouver this morning. We've been on the road for
about four weeks now, starting
in Texas around the first
week of March. We came ^
up through the South we
and then hit Spring Break
in Florida during the
storm of the century.
Actually we've experienced a lot of weather on
this tour: floods, snow,
hail reaching the size of
golf balls, locusts, fights and
security...you know, the usual.
You're playing an all ages
gig tonight, it that important to you?
Yes, definitely, all our shows
on this tour are all ages. If they
weren't, it would eliminate a
large part of House of Pain's
audience. We prefer to keep
control of ourown affairs, however for this tour we have allowed a booking agent to do it.
Actually, five months ago we
played an all ages show at the

show? Do you find it hard to
get out on stage?
For sure, I'm no different than
anyone else, even though I have
done a lot of shows myself. Before Wool I was in a punk band
On the punk scene the majority
of time your are playing in front
of white suburban kids, rather
than a diversity of people.
Do you have a follow up album to Buds pawn com ing out
soon?
Yes, but not that soon. The current
tour ends this weekand then we're
scheduled to do some shows with
Fugazi. After that we'll take a few
weeks off and work on some new
songs before leaving for Europe
with Rage Against the Machine
for a mini-tour. Once we
have finished all these
things, then we will go into
the studio to record our
new album,tentatively entitled Pushing Cloth.
Where will you be recording the new album?
Probably on the east coast
somewhere, (burp!!!) Excuse me. Check. Ha, ha.
Man! I hope I didn't get
your mike dirty. Most of
us, my brother and myself
and drummer Pete Moffet,
are from Washington D.C,
while our Bass player, Al,
is from the other Washington, Washington State.
Also, most of the people
we want to work with are
from the East Coast.
How has the audience
reacted to your music, after all you are
not the biggest
â– ^    band on the bill?
You could say that;
that u
i fair si
D.C.
Are you still friends with Dave
Grehl (ex-Scream drummer
now with Nirvana) at all?
Yes, definitely, he is one of my
good friends. Actually, he came
up with me to the Nappy show. It
was just him and Chris (Novaselic
of Nirvana), plus a few other friends
and a couple of fans. He would
probably be here tonight except
Nirvana played a benefit show last
night in San Francisco. Hopefully
we will do some shows with them
Music is basically for everybody, all races. Music is the basis
of all communication. To me it's a
shame music is split up into different labels and genres.
Most ofthe people that come
to the shows are there to have a
good time. Whereas if you are
opening up for Nirvana or the
Lemonheads you would probably
be playing in front of people that
are just such alternative nudnicks
that they would be just sitting there
and judging you with their arms
crossed making sure that their
friends were thinking this
band is cool. Wool ain't _^i
fuckin' cool, so we don't
go over too well with that.
The people who come to
see House of Pain seem to
be very open young Nubiles
ready to be penetrated with

My father used to manage
bands in the 60's, so my brother

It was the politics ofthe 60' s bands
which inspired me to have something to say with my music rather

Being part of a notorious
LA. scene what is your
stand on drugs?
I think you should experiment
with everything in life and push
yourself to the limit with everything you do. But when something takes over your body and
controls your life, and your destiny, that is when you start to
hurt other people. You do not
only have a responsibility to
yourself, you have responsibility to insure that
you don't hurt ihem. I

with them and another band called

Usually we are able to push
them to do what we want, like
releasing the album on 12 inch
vinyl. But, actually, we encourage people not to buy the album
up here at import prices, it is
just a fucking rip off. We've
ment. Actually, it
has been a really
good experience.
We were tentative
_S about this tour because we didn't
know that much about
Rage Agai nst the Machine.
However, it's been abless-
ing being on tour with them
and getting to know them.
The audience for the
shows must really be mixed...
Yeah, the crowd has not really
been a black audience, like most
people would assume for a rap
band. So far we have had mostly a
white crowd, which is kind of a
drag. On the punk scene the majority of time your are playing in
front of white suburban kids, rather
than a diversity of people.
The Obsessed. We went up and
down the West Coast but nobody
was there. Now they are opening
up for Metallica and we are opening up for House of Pain.
As far as music goes, I love
everything. I like a lot of soul, a
lot of blues and R and B. Also I'm
into a lot of early punk. Much of
the music than inspired me to be
ery for help. It was about me moving to L.A. and the shit that I saw.
Homelessness is so out of control.
Vancouver is so nice and clean
whereas in L.A. you get off the
highway and at every corner there
is someone begging for money.
Even four or five years ago it wasn' t
like that, it has just gotten progressively worse. Today you see a
been pushing to release the album up here in Canada through
Cargo, which looks like it may
happen. Only then will it be
available at a reasonable price.
Right now, I'd prefer you just
steal the fucking thing, or tape
it off a friend. Twenty-eight
bucks for a record is just outrageous, i

Exene Cervenka walked into the lobby of the Chateau Granville, struggling to carry a suitcase half as big as she
was. She and longtime bandmates John Doe, Tony Gilkyson and D.J. Bonebrake had tofly from California two
days after their last stop on a tour to announce their seventh release as a band, Hey Zeus. Resuming their roadwork
in a city that's been good to them in the past, I hoped that I'd be able to catch Exene OB a good day, one where
she'd be her colorful, quotable self. But when she saw me in the lobby and tossed a suspicious glance my way,
I was wishing I'd brought my glove. On a bad day with the (in)convenience of air travel, customs and rush hour
traffic, Cervenka's best stuff can be cranky and caustic at best. At that moment, I would have caught Roger
Clemens without a mask and chest protector than interview her.
Moments later she dragged herself and her luggage back to where I was conversing with a representative
of Polygramâ€”their new distributor. "I was told there's someone here to talk to me," she inquired in her soft
Floridian accent. An introduction and a minute later, I was interviewing a member of a band whose place in the
history book (make that pamphlet) of Alternative music is secure. We sat down on a lobby couch.
While I was fiddling with my tape recorder, Exene eyed one of my Tattoos open from my tank topped arm.
"Hmmmrn...* bal," she discovered. (Exene owns quite a few of them herself.) As the interview progressed, I
wondered why she and the rest of X decided to come back and resume suffering the shit-kicking they were
receiving from the music press, and a few of their followers, six years ago.
You don't have to be an old fart to understand the history of X, but it helps. In 1988, Cervenka and her
confederates decided to mothball the band for a while, following the mixed reception to their last record See How
We Are. Many ofthe reviewers, and a few hardened fans, as liked the songs but focused oa tbe supposed
inadequacies of Gilkysoo's guitar work ("HE'S NO BILLY ZOOM").
So after a distinguished run that begun in the volatile Los Angeles punk movement of the early eighties and
that ended withaccusat ions of selling out by the alternative movement of thai period, they decided to take a break.
"We weren't at the rime taking a sabbatical, we just didn't book any gigs. We didn't feel like playing and didn't
realize k was going to take a while to do different things. It wasn't anything we thought or cared about. People
kept asking if we were going to play again and we didn't really ever know."
Tlie summer vacation lasted about three years. Doe immersed himself in film acting and made a solo record
(Meet John Doe â€”Geffen). Bonebrake became a hired gun drummer for Syd Straw, Michael Penn and Steve
Wynn. Cervenka and her family packed and picked up for Idaho, where she lived off and on for five years.
While living there she decided to take up music again. "I wasn't really planning on doing music, but then
I started writing songs and decided 'well, I do like this music thing after all'. I was hoping to just do writing so
I wouldn't have to keep going back to L.A. all the time. I like music".
The resultant discs (Old Wives' Tales, Running Sacred â€” Rhino, on which Gilkyson maintained his
working relationship with Cervenka by producing and playing guitar on both efforts) re-affirmed Exene's lyrical
abilities and helped her develop new ones she could apply when and if X got back together; "I started writing
music, which I couldn't have done if we hadn't have taken that time off. I had to get away from John, and I don't
mean that in a negative way, but our partnership was one where words and music did not fit together for us easily."
Cervenka's work habits also received an overhaul during the break. "For one thing, I'm sober personally.
Not that I wrote every song in the world when I was drunk or anything like that, but it's been almost two years,
so my perception of reality and my way of looking at the psychology of being an artist is different. The myth of
chemical enlightenment is banished like it should be, and that's good because that opens up all kinds of new ways
of expressing yourself."
The strength she acquired during the hiatus might, ironically enough, pull her and Doe back together as
collaborators again; "John and I don't write together as much, but I think we're going to now, so I think it's going
to return to how it used to be," stated Cervenka. "You should do the same thing over and over if it's working for
you. And if it doesn't, that's when you do something different. It's logical as an artist. Whatever's going to work
is what you do."
Returning to a healthier, more receptive market for alternative music hasn't dimmed Cervenka's memories
of tougher times; "It's a different society, different economy, different culture and outlook," she observed. "I'll
never forget the struggle of what we were doing and how difficult it was. Not too many people on this planet
would know how hard it was: Social Distortion know, Paul Westerburg knows, Soul Asylum know, and a lot of
bands that have broken up know, how thoroughly discouraging it was every step ofthe way. Which isn't to say
it wasn't a lot of fun being underground, but it was really upsetting that the radio was censuring music. We had
a good time battling and

Cervenka. "You won't be able to make any sense out of it, that's for

Seattle. As the culture-appropriating behomoths move on In search of a fresh "buzz," bands like engine kid still grow
between the cracks, like weeds In the sidewalk. Greg, Brian and Chris formed engine kid about a year ago In the suburbs
of Seattle, and put out a 7" on their own label. Battery Records. Since then, they've been working with C/Z records,
readying for the release of their first album, Bear Catching Fish, at the end of September. This Interview took place
before the band opened for Sebadoh at the Town Pump. Tim from CKCU radio In Ottawa also took part In the Interview.
Who are you?
G: I'm Greg from engine kid and this is Brian from
engine kid.
How long has engine kid been together?
G: With Brian in the band almost a year, and about six
months before Brian was in the band.
If you had to be any type of fruit what type of fruit
would you be?
G: Geez, I don't know. I guess an orange, I don't know
why, I just like oranges. That's a Brian kind of question, what kind of fruit would you be Brian?
Brian: A pomegranate, there's a lot to offer there.
(Laughs)
Would you e'
r consider signing onto a major la-
G: I don't know, it would depend on what kind of deal
was involved and what sort of things were written into
the contract. It's not something I think about too often,
we haven't been approached by any.
T: How did you get the attention of C/Z?
G: They bought and liked the 7" we put out ourselves
and then they came to see us play and that was it. We
didn't really approach anybody.
How long have you had your nose?
G: My nose? I just recently purchased it.
B: I got mine at a two for one sale so I have one on
reserve in case something blows up.
Has engine kid always been based out of Seattle?
G: I live in the suburbs of Seattle and so does Brian,
Chris lives in the city. But I guess we are from Seattle.
Has the band been affected by the grunge craze?
B:No.
G: Not at all.
B: We're more affected by eighties power rock. (Laughs)
Has the local scene been devastated by grunge?
G: Yeah, it's pretty lame actually, there's not that many
good bands around. People aren't very receptive to any
new sounds. Also, a lot of people are tired of going to
clubs and seeing ripoff grunge bands. The all ages
scene is cool when it happens, lots of people show up
and everybody is really cool and open minded, but
there aren't many all ages shows.
Tell me about your straightedge past, don't you
have a special tattoo?
G: I don't know if it's directly related to straightedge,
I was really into it about five years ago and I had a
really good time playing in bands. It was fun.
Doesn't your tattoo say 'straightedge till death*?
G: It says 'true till death' actually, it doesn't have too
much to do with straightedge. I got it when I was
straightedge.
T: Do you see a new genre of music forming with
you and Codeine and Slint?
G: That kind of music has been around for awhile and
that's who we've been inspired by. As far as a new
Do you have any reservations about playing bars?
G: Sometimes I miss the feeling of having kids put on
shows and there being no business license involved,
it's more of a special thing. Bands probably play here
every night; people don't go for a special reason. When
kids put on all ages shows it has this intense sort of
feeling where it's like this could be closed down any
minute. If we had a choice we'd play all ages, but a lot
of times we don't have a choice.
Who's your favourite Vancouver band?
G: Aww shit, I'd have to say it's a toss up between
Stovebolt and uh, what's that other fucking band?
Aww, I don't know, I like Sparkmarker and Stovebolt,
they are really cool.
Is there much of a difference between your older
and newer music?
G: I think it's growing, I hope so at least. We're
getting tighter.
T: What can we expect from your new
album?
G: It sounds really live,
live than the CD5. The CD5 had
lot of reverb on it and a lot of effects
whereas the new album has
hardly any studio effects
on it. With the new album
we' ve developed our i

to be compared to

they're really amazing. But it

personal experiences, in any way, your childhood
experiences affects your music. I had some pretty
interesting things happen to me during my childhood, a lot of things I write reflect it.
G: Uh, having gone through family divorces and
regular family bullshit.
Are there any cool bands still left in Seattle?

Does your personal political viewpoint effect your
music in any way?
G: I have lots of political opinions but I don't really
try to express them in my music; I think there's a lot
of bands who do that way better than I ever could. I   .
don't have a goal in mind when I write.
Ifyou found out that pencils were actually intelligent life forms and had there own underground
society would you risk your own life to save the
pencils' secret?
G: Yeah, I could handle writing with abic forthe rest
of my life, that would be O.K. But our bass player
Brian would uncover the whole thing, he wouldn't
give a shit.
What is the band's plans for the future?
G: After the Sebadoh shows we're going to take a
break and then the new album will be out. After that
we'll go back on tour and hopefully we can play an
all ages show in Vancouver, maybe we could even
play in Blast records again. Is that place still around,
Which band member smells the worst?
G: That would have to be the drummer. He uses all
these crazy creams and he brushes his teeth with
'Tom's Baking Powder'. He's disgusting.
Do you have any bizarre touring stories?
G: When we were on tour we kept on hearing that
Sparkmarker were homosexual. We were in San
Diego and some guy pulls me aside and says really
seriously, "I saw Kim from Sparkmarker kissing one
of the guys from Undertow in a full embrace, are
they gay?" So our goal on tour was to let everyone
know that Sparkmarker were indeed all homosexual
and that they were carrying the flag of homosexual
hardcore.
Which band member has the worst flatulence?
G: That would have to be Chris again, because when
*â–    was going through his vegan phase he had the
smelling farts, as all vegans do.
What's your favourite food?
G: The Coffee Crisp, which you can onl y get
Canada.
Did you like thrash metal when you
G: I liked thrash metal when I was 15.
Well, first I got into metal and then I got
into punk, the two blended together and it

the time was Fratricide.
Who was in Fratricide?
G: Eric was in that band and lhat Dan guy,
rocker Dan.
What do you think of Eric Thorkelsson?
s a great guy, he's kind of a
legend in Seattle and San Diego. Whenever we go down there people ask us
what happened to Eric from Headstart
or Headfirst or whatever the hell they
were called. Is he going to be here
tonight?
don't think he likes clubs.
Can you give u
.ny examples?

God smiled on us, however,
when we attended-the first ever
Gospel Music Workshop of
American's (G.M.W.A.) Western
Regional Conference in Tacoma,
Wa. We were in the presence of
some of the best gospel choirs,
soloists, musicians, songwriters,
directors and
preachers from all
over the Western
States and "We
had church!"
(We're not wor-
worthy," was
heard from the
both of us all
weekend long.)
The Gospel
Music Workshop
of America was
begun in the late
sixties by the late
Rev. James
Cleveland. He had
the vision to bring
from the black churches in
America together in order to expose songwriters, musicians, singers and directors to one another
The workshop would be a
place to hear what others were
doing in the other parts ofthe country in order to develop a black
gospel network.
Today, the workshop has a
National Convention (this year in
Indianapolis) which will draw
20,000 members. It's main fea
tures include performances by
chapter choirs, seminars on the
fundamentals of gospel music, as
well as the forming, rehearsing,
performance and recording of a
Mass Choir.
The West Coast Regional
Conference mirrored all the features of the National Convention:
they had a Mass Choir made up of
all the delegates â€” even Brother
Vince and myself. We learned ten
new songs in two days, performing them at a concert which was
recorded by Pepper Co. Records.
(We're not worthy and we know
it).
On the first night of the Conference we were sitting in the
Bethlehem Baptist Church, listening to some of the best choirs
we're likely ever to hear, when, to
our surprise, in walked Billy
Billy Preston, who is the
keyboard player for the Daths and
a Grammy winner, sat down at
the organ and played a scorching
rendition of Thomas A. Dorsey's
standard "Precious Lord Take My
Hand." We also had a chance to
talk with him.
Billy Preston: It's good being here!
My sister (Rodenna Preston) is
one of the board members of this
Gospel Music Workshop. So I
came to support her. In fact, I'm
doing a song on the album as well.
Many people know you for your
Grammy winning album "I
Wrote a Simple Song," as well
as, your work with many greats
in rock history. But what are
your roots in gospel?
Gospel is definitely in my roots. I
started playing when I was three
years old. I'm from a musical family: my brother and sister play the
piano, and all my beginnings were
in the church choir.
My first big gig was playing
for Mahalia Jackson and I' ve been
blessed to have a chance to play
with a lot of people. I consider it a
blessing because I was never asked
to audition for anybody; they
would call me.
In recent years I've been getting closer to God because I ran
into trouble with drugs and being
out in that life. I'll do everything I
can, including using my music, to
glorify Him.
Please describe your journey for
us; what has it been like for you
of the past few years?
The past few years have been great.
Out of every trial there's a lesson
to be learned. I'm thankful to God
that I did get busted for drugs because I probably would never have
stopped.
I think you have to go through
something to get to some thing. Unfortunately, it had to be drugs. I' m
grateful to God that I survived all
that.
I've been around drugs all
my life because I was part of the
business. It became a normal thing
that I didn't think much about for
many years. By the grace of God,
I've been helped.
Of course, I went through
treatment, but it's a spiritual connection that you have
to make in order to
survive in this world
today. You have to

side in order to make

This workshop is
amazing. People
coining together for three days
and making an album. Does it
usually work this way?
Usually they have a week to rehearse, but this is the first annual
(Western) regional meeting that
they've had. Everybody learns
their parts real quick. It's going to
be a good album.
Come to the Gospel Music Workshop of America! It's a good loving group, it's a good fellowship
because you're with people who
are doing the same thing and you
leam quite a bit.
We also had a chance to meet
Ed Smith, the Executive Director
of the G.M.W.A.
What was James Cleveland's vision for gospel? I know he influenced songwriting and gospel ar-
rangment a great deal. Were
in Detroit, Mich, some sixteen
years ago, to over half-a-million
people who are in over 184 chapters all over the world.
From Rev. Calvin Rhone, one
of the songwriters and directors,
we learned what the expression
"we had church means": "It's a
phrase of worship experience... I
believe that it's somewhat unique
to the black worship experience,
but it could also be used for the
Pentecostal or Charismatic worship experience where a lot of
anybody either."
Some church ladies:
"The Devil's a liar!"
"Sure He is!"
"Always has been!"
A Choir director from Seattle:
"I don't care if you can sing, do
scales, play piano like an octopus
with eight armsâ€”if God   isn't in
it!!"
And...
"He didn't have nothing; he was as

E.S.: Well, yes. He wanted to see
that gospel music was done in a
very positive and first-class way.
That's why it was a burden on him
to start the workshop, where every
person can come and exchange
ideas and learn about staging gospel: to learn how to present it in a
very professional way.
He felt that he went to too
many churches where the musicians were just haphazardly doing
it. He felt that this was God's music and it should be done first class.
He then formed the convention. It grew from 19 people in a
litde hotel room in the Gordon Inn

the presence of the Lord. We are
so engulfed by this goodness and
His kindness and what He's done,
that we have a feeling. We have a

a feeling to tap our feet. We have
a feeling to stand-up and shout.
We have a feeling to dance and
just feel full of joy. It's a personal
experience and you have to experience it for yourself to really understand it."
We also heard some great
lines: Rev. Kenneth Ulma before
his sermon: "I'm not trying to hit
anybody; I'm not trying to miss
broke as the Ten Commandments."
"Woman, marry that ugly man.
He'll be good to you."
The lady sitting next to me in the
Mass Choir:
"You're a hockey fan too! Love

Understanding Comics
(Tundra, 215 pgs, pb $24.95)
Scott McCloud is my kind of teacher! This comics expert has written a
book on the history of comics and
how to better appreciate them. Sub-
tided The Invisible Art, the study is
written entirely in comic form with
Scott himself as our guide. This
being an academic venture, Scott is
wearing a suit-jacket however this
is forgiven as he's wearing a Zot! t-
shirt underneath.
Various art concepts such as
closure, mood and identity are discussed. Scott compares the range
and style of comic artists from various generations; he gives us a history of comics (waaaay back in time
we go) and he is even shown jumping hurdles in the nude to graphical
ly explain his point. Now, that's
jfiW
itsmm
dedication.
Understanding Comics is for
anyone who wants to learn the visual language of comix. And any study
that would take the time to talk
about word balloons is okay by me.
It's all so inspiring: My wretched
doodling has vastly improved since

Virtual Light

WilliamGibson's newbook Virtual
Light may well be his most accessible yet. Within its pages our everyday world is escalated to another

things are the same, yet different.

he looks like Tommy Lee Jones
while Chevette Washington, the female protaganist is a bicycle couri-
Rydell is a rent-a-cop down
on his luck who's just been bumped
from a lucrative appearance on the
Cops In Trouble televison show.
His troubles truly begin when he's
hired to drive a car for some shady
characters. His path is soon to cross
with Chevette, who rides the coolest
rice-paper bicycle around but has
stolen something she shouldn't have.
One enjoyable aspect of Gibson's books is they are basically
good versus evil tales. The bad guys in
this case are almost stereotypical â€”
would you believe a robotlike mad
Russian? â€” comy...but it works. Virtual Light is a belie vable take on what

And as for fashion, fer sure! they

Truly, though, the spirit of
punk was an American invention,
borne of idle youth in NY and other

Ever wonder what People Are
Reading? I do. Author Michael
Turner, the dashing host of the
Reading Railroad, took the time
to write and tell subtext.
Much of my reading time is divided between editing r
scripts and scanning forthcoming books sent to me by publishers interested in having their i
thors read at the Reading Railroad series (every third Monday
@ the Railway Cluh -j).
Since I am writing this article in
August, I've decided to discuss
books that have either just been
published or will be published
shortly after this appears.
What follows, then, is a list of
nine books that I would recommend for fall reading:
Visions of Kerouac (Pottersfield
Press) by Ken McGoogan
A cleveriy told Jack-and-the-
beat -schtick story where the central character is joined by the
ghost of Kerouac on a romp
around North America The author's rendering of the "current"
Kerouac is pitch-perfect, suggesting to me that McGoogan is more
likelyawas-a-beatthana wanna-
beat. Easy to read, though the
book wanes a bit near the end.
Watch for the shifting point-of-
Homage to Lester Young (Ooli-
chan) by Jaime Reid
A long poem about the jazz great.
Reid's jam on Young is consistent with the style of his subject:
Always on the hep side of the
best, always in the pocket. And
unlike McGoogan, who blows a
bit too long on Kerouac Reid
knows when to put down his hom.
/ Can Hear Me Fine (Get To The
Point Books) by Jean Smith
An impressionistic tale of memory and dreams skewing time and
space from the singing side of
Mecca Normal. The characters
are weird and real; the writing
orange and brilliant. And for in-
check out the index!
Smith's best vocal perfor
Show Business (Serpent's Tail/High
Risk books) by Kevin Coyne
A series of prose pieces and dialogues about "the real worid of entertainment." coy ne, a fifty year olf
British rock star Uving in Germany
has an arid sense of humour â€” and
he uses it well with stories like The-
Has-Been, Johnny and the Psychiatrist, and Ezra Pound in his Cage.
Reminds me of my own book, Hard
Core Logo, only this one is informed by the Cliff Richard era.
Borderlines (Serpent's Tail/High
Risk Books) ed. by Kate Pullinger
An absorbing anthology of writing
on "home" and "exile" from the co-
publishers who brought you Show
Business. Rather than go into detail
on the nineteen stories (written by
authors such as Joe Ambrose,
Hooman Majd, and Audrey Thomas) included in this book, let me
just say that Serpent's Tail/High
Risk is one of the most interesting
newpublishers around today. Watch
for new books by John Giorno, Gary
Indiana, and Sapphireâ€”as well as
this one.
Skinnier Leg OfThe Journey (Black
Cat collective) Rob Howatson, Anne
Jew and Lisa Marr
This is probably the most engaging
anthology I have read in some time.
More than mere travel writing, this
collection is about passage. All
three authors, contributing three
stories each, really shine here. And,
yes, Rob Howatson's eyes are the
ones he was born with.
Queeries: An Anthology of Gay
Male Prose (Arsenal Pulp Press)
edited by Dennis Dennisoff
Twenty-six authors (including
Stan Persky, Andy Quan, and David Watmough) contributed to this
dynamic book, the first anthology
of gay male prose ever published
in Canada. Although the writing is
solid and wide-ranging, the most
fascinating aspect of this collection is the authors' synopses ofthe
political intentions behind their
work. In terms of sheer insight,
this book swings both ways.
Dwell (Talonbooks) by Jeff
Derksen
A long poem by one ofthe young
lions of new lyric writing. What
I liked best about this book (indeed, about new lyric writing in
general) is the way it challenges
our narrative bias, the way our
reading-comprehension-writing
"skills" have been conditioned
by discursive power structures
(i.e. media, education, law,
health, politics). The Interface
passage is one of the best pieces
of writing I have read this year.
Paper, Scissors, Rock (Press
Gang) by Anne Decter
If I were an Olympic judge, I
would give this book perfect
marks for both technique and
style. Although a novel, this book
reads more like a long poem: A
tight weave of lyric and dialogue,
emotion and history. I learned
more about my country from this
book than I ever did from Mordecai Richler.

Or that Cheers is on five times a

average network comedy that often featured some very sharp writing but does it have to be available twenty-six times a week?
To start naming some names,
Ted Turnerhas optioned the rights
to the title King Schlock. Besides
ation, the broadcaster is not responsible to commercial i nterests
to keep the station financially
afloat but, rather, to the audience
who fund such enterprises through
donation (e.g. PBS in the U.S.) or
through taxation (e.g. CBC in
Canada and BBC in Britain).
It is this relative liberty from
the interests ofthe almighty buck
that allow these types of stations
to break the yoke of conformity
that is imposed on commercial
stations. When Seinfeld, one of
network TV's most credible and
gut-funny shows, decided to run
their "Masturbation" episode,
eight out of ten of their regular
advertisers cancelled their spots
during the show. They pulled out
of very expensive prime time slots
on a very high rated "hip" show
because they were afraid most
viewers would be so offended by
the hint of masturbation (something 50% of all women and 90%
of all men admit to doing); that
the products being advertised in
the breaks would take on some
sort of taint and become
unmarketable. The slots were immediately filled by other sponsors and the episode received the
highest rating Seinfeld (ital) had
acheived to that point in its two
year run. But had the incident
occured with a less popular show,
those eight advertisers would
probably have succeeded in their
blatant attempt at censorship.
By contrast, last year CBC
cut their "Weeper". They decided,
without fanfare, that their audience after 10 pm were primarily
mature adults who could handle a
few undiluted and uncensored
swear words. Because of this decision, their Thursday Canadian
movie showcase was one of the
highlights of thei r schedule. Never
on an American non-cable channel would you be able to see such
controversial, and excellent, fare
as Leolo, Dead Ringers, and Jesus of Montreal in exactly the
same form as they were shown in
the theatres, save for a few commercial breaks.
If anything is offensive, it is
not the word "fuck" and not the
sight of an unclad penis but the
banality and homogeny of network TV.  Besides  the  holy
easily the most biting satire to hit
the box since The Kids in the Hall
debuted back in '88, is on HBO
and imported to Canada by CBC.
In the States, but only in some
markets and very late at night,
CBS broadcasts the aforementioned Kids; however the shows
are produced in the Toronto studios of CBC. Where In The World
Is Carmen Sandiego (not just a
kids game show but a truly entertaining way to pass the time until
dinner is ready) and the ever
hu mourous Sesame Street are both
PBS productions. From the BBC,
PBS regularly brings to North
America such small screen classics as Floyd on France (and Britain and Spain and Australia and
Ireland), Red Dwarf, Singing Detective, and Black Adder.
And then there is educational
TV which you can hardly be surprised to find that I'm advocating, considering the natural flow
from thinking to hating network
pablum television to enjoying
visually and intellectually stimulating stuff. This is where the
stigma associated with watching
shows that are "good for you"
ends. I refuse to apologise or explain my enthusiasm for such
beautifully mind boggling series
as Connections or The Day the
Universe Changed which are both
written and narrated by the ever-
charming James Burke. These series are both often rerun on TLC
and PBS, and they epitomise the
best of non-fiction television.
Using light humour, extensive research, well-costumed
dramatizations, and the profound
mind of Prof. Burke, both explain
elements of societal change in
western civilization from Roman
times to the present. The information relayed is never babified for
the audience, but the subjects discussed are simplified and elaborated on so that those (like myself) who may not be geniuses
can still get into the proceedings.
An interest in anything from painting to trains to sound technology
to the bomb is all that is required
to enjoy these series.
There are those people who,
despite anything they may read in
Discorder, will still only be inter-
estcdin infomcrcials, heavy metal
videos, and TNN's monster truck
and dirt bike Sunday extravaganza. The next time you sit down
in front of that wacky invention
called television, carefully consider your options, demand more
from those who are presenting
you with those options, and please
don't blame that innocent mess of
plastics, copper, and invisible
waves for the ills of a society it
was in vented to i mprove. It' s ti me
to pass the responsibility for the
ills of the medium on those who
abuse it so shamelessly for their
triui
of
Seinfeld, and
Northern Exposure (three shows
that, in their way,
challenge the
tight perameters
which they are
expected to function within), everything else
worth watching is
on cable or public television.

SEPTEMBER 0 Discorder: What has changed
for Nomeansno since Andy has
left?
Rob Wright: Andy's not there
anymore! (laughs)... at first
we just took a break, because
we weren't sure how we were
going to proceed. I ended up
being really bored, so I started
doing Mr. Wrong which was
really good because it was
quite different, a challenge,
aad it got me playing every
day.
The majori ty of the songs
on the new (Nomeansno)
album were written and
performed as Mr. Wrong
sons*, which is why I think
20
they tend to be a Uttle simpler
and longer and ponderous instead of the faster, more intricate stuff. When we listened to
the new album we said "Oh my
God, are people going to sit down
and listen to a whole hour of
this?" There were even a couple
of longer ones that we left off
because there wasn't even any
room on the CD.
Discorder: Some people have
compared the sound to your first
LP, Mama, which was also a
product of the band as a two-
Rob: I think it does sound that
way, but only because it has a
preponderance of my material
written on the bass, and that's
also what Mama was. Which
just shows you... I don't change
at all! I've been writing the
same songs for ten years, kids!
I don't know if the next
work will have the same quality to it, because we're starting
to work with other people. The
next thing we're going to do is
a fun compilation album on
Wrong Records. It may not
even be a Nomeansno album,
with lots of guests and covers
and weird stuff... sort of like a
CD magazine in music form.
Discorder: What is happening
with Wrong Records? I assume
it started out as an opportunity
to take more control over putting out your material.
Rob: Yeah, people were mailing us, asking for stuff, and we
wouldn't have anything we
could sell them. So we decided
to do a Uttle business selUng
our own T-shirts and albums...
and then there were a lot of
odd things too, things we were
on, 7 inches that were made
around the world, and people
would ask us about them. So
we ordered a whole bunch of
stuff, like the 7 inch from
Finland, and various bootlegs.
I don't know if we'll make it
into an official 'labd'' with
other bands who we'U try to
promote and get out there... I
mean, that's really hard. You'd
have to have a real organization, you'd have to get more
people involved and it would
have to make some money,
which it really doesn't do at
the moment. We're not planning to take over the world or
anything... it's a fun place to
put out side projects and other
things to occupy our time.
Discorder: You 've been in volved
in a lot of side projects over the
years: the Hansons, Show Biz
Giants, the record with Jello,
itch... how did you first approach
Nomeansno when it started?
Was is just another side project?
Rob: No, Nomeansno has always been the central thing
we've done. Especially when
we started playing two-piece,
that was the most focussed
thing... we had done four-track
recordings and played together in that form, but that was
more of a studio thing, just two
guys playing the instruments
and putting the songs out,
which is a whole other thing
than being a live band. We
wanted to be a live band, so we
started the two-piece and since
then, that's been the core of
what we've done. Andrew was
a huge part of the band, obvi- ously, but the essential beginning was myself and John, playing songs with a rhythm-section
emphasis and with a certain
idea and emotional content and
direction. That's why we've
carried on; when Andy left the
band we didn't say "well, we'U
go on to something else." As
long as me and John are playing together, it'll always be
Nomeansno.
Discorder: What is Andy doing
now? The story I heard was that
he was walking around Amsterdam with a gram of pot in his
pocketand thought "Hey, thisis
legal.'"andjust decided to stay...
Rob: He developed a relationship with a woman who had
managed a couple of our tours,
and eventually it got to the point
that his life was there. He just
got sick of the touring, which
had got quite... big. And he
wasn't really comfortable with
that, especially in Europe. He
turned thirty and decided he
had to take a left turn and do
something different. He's been
with us for eight or nine years,
which is a long time for a band
to be together in one format. I
don't really know if he's doing
anything musical at all... I think
he's doing demos and stuff but
whether or not he plans to be
seriously involved in the music
business again, I don't know.
Discorder: What do you think
it's been that has made Nomeansno different from other
"hardcore" bands?
Rob: I think it's because we
started a lot earlier than the
actual "hardcore" scene. The
bands we listened to when we
started playing music were the
Ramones, The Sex Pistols, the
Stranglers and then PiL and
the "second-wave" in England... a little more avant-
garde, where the attitude was
to try out new things... some
reggae rhythms, funk, try and
shake things up. The band was
never about actual politics, it
was more i nto the personal politics and sexual politics of person-to-person issues. When we
finally got touring, we were in
that hardcore "scene," but we
really weren't going the same
way as most of the bands were,
which was reaUy fast music,
intense, often very political
lyrics and a very, very rigid
' format... they wanted to be like
each other, rules of conduct,
things Uke that, with a very
"boys-club dib-dib-dib dob-
dob-dob" feel about it. We were
just a Uttle too old and politically-incorrect to go along with
it. I think what really makes us
different is we've always
wanted to be ourselves, and to
the extent that if you're going
to be yourself, you're going to
be different from everyone else.
Most bands, unfortunately, are
trying to be the band they really
Uke... and unfortunately they
usually succeed. People really
appreciate people who do
things their own way... that's
what people are looking for:
originality, that's what sparks
interest. It's totally wrong-
headed to look at someone else
and say "If I write songs Uke
them, I'll be like them!" By
doing that you're not going to
be true to what's truly inside
yourself. Personality comes
into it as well, not as image, but
actual people. Like the Minutemen, Mike Watt and D.
Boon, these are individual
people, and even if there were
things I didn't Uke, I've always
had a huge respect for that
band, and for fIREHOSE,
simply because they're them-
Discorder: It
reminds me ofthe
you live, it was at
an all-ages show
atthe Town Pump
in'86. There were
about 25 people
there, and as I
was watching the
maker... it can be all these
things, but it really has nothing
to do with what music really is.
If you go someplace and you're
the "rock star," some people
think that's cool, but most
people think it's just a pain in
the ass. I'm just a little to old to
be like that anyways... even if I
tried I don't think I could be
cool, especiaUy now... I'm a
forty-year-old man living in
New Westminster! I'm your
Dad, kids!
Discorder: Have you ever felt
any urge to try jumping into the
mainstream and fucking with
don't do that on a major label,
you're nothing. So why put
yourself in the position of ali
this pressure... for what? So
you'll sell a few more records
and not see any money out of
them? I think we make more
money now selling our 20-
30,000 copies of each album
than bands who seU 90-100,000
on a major label and who spent
$350,000 making it. The only
people who have to do that are
the people who are making full-
scale commercial pop music...
like Prince. I mean, what would
he be doing on Alternative
Tentacles?   I  have  nothing
this six-foot grey-
haired   guy   in
walking across
the dance floor,
bobbing his head
to the music and I
thought, "That
must be their
manager." And
then you climbed
up on stage and
started playing! I
thought you
would be so cool,
but you ended up
being geeky like

Discorder: What does playing in
Nomeansno do for you personally ? What do yo u get to express
through the medium ofthe band
that you might not communicate
otherwise?
Rob: I get to say "fuck you" to
everyone in the world! (laughs)
All those little simmering things
that most people carry around
as ulcers 24 hours a day, I get to
spit them out on stage to
people with some applause at
the end and a few dollars. It's
a way to communicate, and
way to get in contact with
people on a certain level that
most people don't ever get the
opportunity to. I have people
who write me from Texas who
I don't know, who talk to me
about their personal Uves and
say things about the music
that they've related to, and
you begin to realize that
you've made a connection
with these people, although
you've never really met them.
That's what music is about;
the   purpose   of
make you rich and
famous nor is it a
platform for
whatever political
axe you've got to
grind. It's about
making a connection with people
and sharing what
you have in common with
write a song that
comes out of some
sadness in your
life, and someone
hears that song
and feels sad, you
feelings, that you
That's how music
has always been...
people have got together, they've
beat on drums,
they sing, usually
among people
they know, in a
close, tribal or
communal relationship, and ex-
whatever they are
feeling... their
desires, their
rears... music
doesn't need any
other justification
than that. It
doesn't have to
have a "message,"
it doesn't have to
provide a lot of
money for a lot of
people...I'm not
saying you can't
write political and
meaningful songs,
a lot of people
have. Some people
make a good living
and have made a
big difference, it's
not necessarily bad. But the
more you move towards either of those ends, the more
y ou' re movi ng a way from the
central part of what music is,
which is to be with people.
That's the feeling you get
when you're at a great concert... it's Uke "wow!" Those
concerts I'll remember all my
Ufe... that moment, that's what
the value of it is. And that's
what the value is for me
personally, I get to be the
vehicle for that.
Discorder: How does that relate
to your songwriting process?
Rob: Songs that are really good,
that really move people do not
belong to the artists that wrote
them. The artist is the person
who managed to bring the song
out, but if you see the effect it
has on people, you realize that
it's a common thing. It's a Uttle
spooky, and I don't mean to get
mystical about it, but I really
feel that great songs and great
music is a gift that comes
through an artist, and the individual really doesn 't have anything to do with it. A lot of
people confuse themselves with
their music, and that's when
they begin to get fucked up and
think  they're God Almighty
powerful, but it's really not
them â€” that's where they get
confused. They're not the ones
who are doing it, they're the
ones which it's coming through.
Oftentimes a great artist will
suddenly stop producing great
art... why? Are they a different
person? No, it's just that what
they're saying, the things
they're trying to bring out
aren't being communicated
anymore, or they're no longer
what people are interested in,
what people are going through.
Which is when you find people
who do things in their lifetime
that no-one gives a shit about,
and a hundred years later
everyone goes "Wow! This is
so great!" Whatever that artist
was touching on, everyone else
didn't clue into it until a
hundred years later... unfortunately for them! And there's
something sort of religious
about music in that sense. It's a
spiritual thing â€” a way which
people, on levels you really
can't specify, can connect. And
everyone who wanders th rough
the dark on their own,y'know...
the individual, the great... ME -
that's really not the valuable
part, where you get the things
that drive you in life. The things
that are really important and
deep... they're shared by everyone, and everyone is connected by those things. And
that, to me, is the purpose of
music: to bring that connection out.
Discorder: Have the progressions in your lyrical con tent and
themes been a product of
changes on a spiritual or emotional level?
Rob: I think it hasn't progressed so much as it's been
refined. Ifyou listen to the songs
on Mama and you Usten to the
new songs, you find... the same
songs! And I think I've been
literally writing the same song
with different words and music
since that time. All I try to do is
maintain or refine the
understanding of what I'm doing, and by "understanding" I
mean the emotional as opposed
to intellectual; in a song Uke
"Kill Everyone Now" or "Machine" or "I Need You," you'll
find the same direction in songs
SEPTEMBER  ^ from Mama like "Red Devil," or
"Real Love" or "Victory."
They're all trying to get to a
place in the human heart where
people are sad and hopeful at the
same time, angry and needing
love at the same time. These
things are all fused together... I
is that I'm starting to lose a little
of the crap, the mental crap, that
goes along with lyric writing.
Songs I' ve written that have been
failures are songs like "Hunt the
She-Beast," it's this real sort of
intellectual little pompous thing
about sexual politics, and I listen
to it now and say "eeww, it's
such a lot of crap!" It's all
thinking - with a song Kke "Kill
Everyone Now," there's no
"thinking" in that song, there's
no"iflca." It doesn't explain anything and it really doesn't make
much sense, but it has an emotional content and understanding. I could analyze it and cut
this or that out, and say "it's
about individual suicide translated into mass suicide" or whatever, but the less I do that when
I'm writing, the more you just go
"BUt!" and it comes out from
somewhere â€” who knows. The
only craft involved is putting it
together so the impact of what
you're saying is heightened
instead of debilitated.
Discorder What would you say is
the differen ce between songs such
as "Metronome" and "Long
Days" and even "Victory" which
to me symbolize an attempt to
draw strength from inside oneself
in opposition to the outside world,
as opposed to songs like "Joyful
Reunion" or "The River" which
are more accepting of the circumstances that flow around you...
Rob: A song Uke "The River"
deals with the contradiction:
you're alone, and you're a part,
and that situation where neither
is really complete is a very hard
one to take because it doesn't
seem to be any meaning to it
"Joyful Reunion" is also that, in
terms of what drives you in your
life is the thing that might rip
you apart The violence of the
songs is usually a recognition of
the violence that's in life, that no
matter how comfortable your life
is, you're eventually going to
dissolve into a pile of bones. "Metronome" has a lot in common
with "The River" in the sense
that they mean two things at the
same time, "The River" _
is saying that we're al- J
ways alone, we really      m
to be swept away from one
another. But it also implies that
we're all on the same river
together, even if we can't really
see or understand each other in
the flow of thi ngs, and even if the
clear, it's a pretty violent process. "Victory" is the same thing,
it's really about defeat It'sabout
the only victory being the face
you show to that defeat, and perhaps the question of "what is
defeat?" I mean, we're all going
to die, is that something we
should be trying to avoid? Maybe
the issue isn't whether we Uve or
die, it'show you Uve. And maybe
the issue isn't to rid the world of
all evil, but how you deal with
evil. Human beings will always
have one foot in hell and one in
heaven, and if you try to avoid
either one, all you're going to be
is a caricature of a human being
â€” you're going to be pretending, you're going to try to be
getting away from Ufe. The more
ously past their prime, but to me,
that first Ramones album is
perhaps the most perfect piece
of music ever written. It was a
revelation to me when I first
bought K... I used to play it twelve
times a day and people would
say "Would you turn off that
shit!'... I mean, no-one liked this
music when I started listening to
it The same sort of thing hit me
with Hendrix as a teenager...
John Lee Hooker, Hank Williams. I think it's just people who,
by accident or design manage to
be themselves and let it come
out I don't like any of Hendrix's
songs... his words are all crap,
but when you take those solos...
there you've got it! And with the
Ramones, it was as if everything
was nothing: they couldn't play,
they had nothing to say, a bad
attitude about everything, and
yet they put fourteen close-to-
perfect Uttle pop songs on that
record. So I don't knowif they're
"heroes," but there are a lot of
you avoid the evil things, in terms
of facing up to them as they're
there, as they present themselves,
the more you're going to alienate yourself from the good things
in life as well. "Metronome" is
Uke "Machine," in that you are
controlled, you are part of a
machine, and you can't escape
that, and in some cases you never
would want to, because in a way,
that machine is the structure by
which you U ve. There's that band
called Rage Against The Machine, it's a very cUched a tt it ude
to be "against the powers that
oppress," but if people were really
faced with the dissolution of that
order, they'd just be grasping
for a new one! Because that's
what you hang your hat on, how
you get up on time in the morning
and stop at the stop sign... so all
if this stuff you don't want to
throw out... it keeps you safe and
gets you through the day. Everyone carries within them the
rules of conduct, and in many
ways we're not individuals, we
are communal creatures, part of
a huge human machine that we
all carry with us. These are contradictions which sort of whip
around... this is the source of the
inspiration that these songs end
up coming out as.
Discorder: Do you have any rock
heroes left?
Rob: Sure... Jimi Hendrix, The
Sex Pistols, The Ramones... I
i, The Ramones arc obvi-
bands who I look at and say "they
did this perfectly." I can't think
of any recently... it's more people I've met through the band,
like Snuff or The X from Holland. They're people I've got to
know as human beings, and
that's different from those 'legendary figures" that you don't
really know anything about...
Discorder: How about bass he-
Rob. Lemmy! I think that's the
very sound I've been looking for
all my Ufe... and people whose
names Ican't remember: the guy
who used to play for The Stranglers... terrible band nowadays,
always was in a way, an extremely
dodgy band, but amazing bass
playing and a menacing quality
to their music... Jah Wobble from
PiL.- I've always had a great
admiration for the bassist for
The Attractions: if you want to
hear an amazing bass player,
put on Get Happy and Usten to
the bass lines.
Discorder I'm at the point where
I want to jump off into the Guitar
Player section of the interview,
but I'11 try to restrain myself. Just
how long have you been playing?
Rob: Since I was 16 on guitar,
but I didn't play in front of
anyone until I was 23 or 24. I
then I started playing bass and
guitar because me and my
brother were recording on a four-
_u_
track. Basically what started our
musical career was a) the "new"
music, and b) the four-track,
because then we started making
those songs with two mikes in
our basement We did that for a
good two years before we ever
tried to play Uve in any context
That's another reason why the
new album is very much Uke
Mama, because it's a totally
studio thing, it wasn't done Uve
at all. The songs were played Uve
on all our other records, which is
maybe why Live And Cuddly is
one of the best representations
of what we did with Andy,
because with him we were basically a Uve band, and that's what
gotu
kfora
"Most bands* unfortunately, are trying
to be the band they really like... and
unfortunately they usually succeed."
lot of people, the Uve show was
first and the records were a close
second... if that! (laughs)
Discorder: On some of your earlier recordings with Andy it seemed
as though you were grasping for a
faithful studio sound, which didn't
happen until Wrong.
Rob: Yeah, and in a funny way,
that was probably the most successfully performed and recorded record, but to me, it's not one
of my fa vou rites at aU, because it
doesn't have that much depth. I
prefer Small Parts and the new
album, but I can see how people
would like them both less than
Wrong. And I knew when we
were doing it that it would be our
most popular record, and I also
knew it was the one I'd like the
least Not to say I don't like it, I
Uke it a lot â€” It's just that I Uke
things that are way less accessi-
I think when you've hit the disturbance level, you're actually
getting into the meat of things. If
you can bug people and disturb
them, they're not going to Uke
that much. That's why we'U
never be a commercial band,
because the majority of people
will never want to hear that kind
of music. If you're trying to
disturb people, you're defeating
your purpose by thinking that
you're going to seU a lot of
records. There will always be a
few people who are actually
searching for that kind of confrontation with music - but not
many. I tliink we're damn lucky
to be as popular as we are, I
always sort of thought it was a
fluke, actuaUy.
As you can see, Rob had a lot to
say; we talked for over an hour.
He was every bit as friendly and
open as he is on stage, and even
gave me a ride to the bus stop in
his station wagon. Nomeansno
will be doing a tour of Australia
this fall with Tom Holliston ofthe
Show Business Giants on guitar.

An excellent overview of Ihe different   t

comp is not as great as one would hope, but
there are a few standout tracks, and it reveals
Vancouver scene to be relatively varied
r me, the best songs are
^       performed by Feed Your Babyhead
s^    (quirky, odd noise with melodic erhoey vocals), (tod Sugar (with a hypnotically
catchy heavy riff), Facepuller (the CD is
y      almost worth having just for the heavy raw

powerful rock, although not quite as amazing as some of the songs on their last demo).

the cruel
elephant
concert productions present:
This is to confirm your worst fears. The cruel elephant is back.
Back I tell you! And we're not gonna take it anymore. This town
was pretty weak for good shows unless they were the odd big
buck multinational corporate controlled rock show worth going
to. So do your part and don't contribute to the exploitation of
third world countries or our own. Think Ihe cruel elephant. We
now have the best sound system of all the cruel elephants,
provided by the experts at Audio Applications. The next time
you go to a show and wonder how this all got so predictable.
Think Change. Think INDEPENDENT. Think the cruel elephant..
Vancouver's only live alternative venue since 1990.1 could list a
bunch of amazing shows that happened in the past so you
could say "WOW, I didn't know they played, that must have
been awesome!* or smugly say, "Yeah, I was at that show, it
rocked my world." It's not just a Punk thing. Ifs not just a noise
thing. It's not just a Grunge (for lack of a better word) thing. It's
not just an Art thing. It's a rock thing for all people of this fine city
and beyond. Those who forget the past will be forced to repeat
it, and that's okay by me. Well as far as music goes anyway. Suck
up a little history and don't miss a show or you'll be sorry!

SMASHING PUMPIKINS - Siamese Dream
"I was trying to get tbe sound of things like
coughing angels, the king and queen of the prom setting
themselves on fire, losers getting laid, high hopes being
ripped down and fizzling out"
- Billy Corgan
Siamese Dream, SMASHING PUMPKINS'
,  second full length release, is over an hour's worth of
spiritual and sonic transcendence. Its thirteen songs are
massive yet sharply focussed, overwhelmingly yet
frighteningly direct.
SMASHING PUMPKINS' love of entropy
and noise is equalled only by their penchant for
tunefulness. The band harnesses chaos without
sacrificing power and spins glassine melodies. On
Siamese Dream t the band reaches a level of
mastery, transferring this highly developed craft
into a breathtaking emotional wallop. Every song
hits pressure points that most people have either
repressed or forgotten. The resulting chills,
pheromones, and endorphins are only slightly less
dangerous than real drugs...or real love...
CRACKER - Kerosene Hat
" Songwriting is like stripping," drawls
CRACKERS's David Lowery, "Some dancers just go a
little further than others."
Kerosene Hat marks a watershed in David
Lowery's career, which spans eight albums with
Camper Van Beethoven and CRACKER.
Demonstrating an artful flare for burlesque,
CRACKER'S new album peels down to its bare artistic
essence. Among the collection of vignettes and
oddities, you'll still find the up-tempo humour that
fuelled CRACKER'S acclaimed self-titled
1992 debut, and its hit single, Teen Angst".
Yet a darker streak underscores many of
Kerosene Hat's new rockers, exemplified by  L
the debut single, "low" and its film noir video I
featuring Lowery in a boxing ring with Sandra I
Bernhard a la Raging Bull.. J
Lowery admits, "I get a big kick out of I
occaisionally writing songs like "Teen Angst" j
-1 think its a really eloquent little tirade. I feel j
comfortable with using irony and sarcasm in
my songs."

RED McJANN GETS HER MONEYS WORTH
Oooh, I get to go to Highwood, the
gran-daddy of the Lollapaloozas, the
gear white-capper and sleazy cousin to
the more honorable In-Fest which happened nary a week prior to Highwood
'93.
How in the world doe. Alberta
think it can get away with having not
one but TWO economy-sized
Woodstocks, both outrageously priced
for your average canuck GAIN-
chequing sociali er ..non-conformist?
How does Alberta(the Texas of Canada)
think it will sustain the interest and
dollars of several thousand fickle North
American slackers under the guise of
"Hey we're havin' a whikkid pardee
somewhere in tbe Canadian prairies...
ya gotta come and bring lots of cash!"
It sounds impossible and totally
unreasonable, but I'm almost certain
that next to the Calgary stampede, these
big indie shindigs are Alberta's only
plausable tourist attraction that have
any relation to some kind of 'culture'.
Oh and what culture! Pepsi cans
standing six feet high as the gods of
good hick and prosperity that all our
little modern primitives have come to
adore and endure. I didn't have to pay
to get in and I didn't have to suck
anyone off to get here. The world slowly
turns and I jes sit here and impress
Friday Aug. 13, dawn...
People are cramming their tents
as close to the highway as possible
while we select a posh site beside the
Smithrite. The two sunglasses vendors
I arrived with (whom are my saving
grace as far as admission goes) leave in
search of brotherhood and beer.
Meanwhile I sit in the van and
take a slow pan of the campers around
me. No one is my brother yet In fact,
the only people awake are some diehard hay head festival arena puds: misguided faith-riddled partiers that wili
yell "WUUU WUU!!" for the rest <*
their Woodstock-missin' lives. This
particular gaggle was standing around,
drinking, and listening to Hawaii-era
Elvis: wasted days and wasted nights.
...10:15 a.m
I drag my sorry ass to the gale to
get my stinking wristband. The vendors are just starting to set up and are
more than mirroring the mood I'm in.
A fiesty nine-year-old snaps the band
on me and I'm practically back to sleep
already. Halfway back to the van, a
security guard yells "I know,
lemm ieguess, you' re BORED already,
aincha?!" I cheerily explain to him that
I'm really quite taken with the goings-
on but I now must rest I marveled in
the pop culture splendor of it all, rolling gently into a nap that would last
until late in the day.
...lata in tha day
You can't just jump into a
crowd sans amphetamines. The
crowd provides too much distraction, the few thoughts you
lazy head become erased. You
don't think at all. You let the crowd
start thinking for you. You become
angry. You are angry at yourself for
losing control. You are angry at the
crowd for luring you into this void, and
you must MOSH. You get anxious and
MOSH like the animal you ve, MOSH
like the WIND, damn you, mosh all tbe
pain and suffering awayyyy...
I dunno, maybe you can just sit
in your little van and write little knee-
jerk sociological rants for your little
paper...
I opted for the latter as King
Missile took the stage. While I love
listening to that crazy "Detachable
Penis" song on the radio and I think
that the Scorcese tribute on the flipside
of their hit-packed cassette was just
d-S right-on and solid, Uve they are no
treat.
I've been tent-bopping the two
stages for hours and I have to say it
warms my heart to see the beer gardens
empty and the local band tent nearly
tent right now; it sounds better than
King Missile but it's a whopping two
dollars that I really should save to buy
a Pepsi later. Gotta have it
The really good band I saw was
Squat from Calgary (conveniently opposite of D.R.I on the big stage). Perhaps I only really liked them because
the Boo Jovi-looking security guy who
doubled as the M.C. rushed the stage
after they played and blurted "That
was Squat, they're largely misunderstood, but perhaps that -because they're
light years ahead of their time!"
Squat are four lovely women
from Calgary who probably don't want
to stay at
the freakshow in the      sportycarsalready(oneofthembroug_t      tumes. Instead, they were relentless.

Saturday Aug. 141:30 pm
The morning started with another Calgary bandcalled Rougue Pope.
Suprisingly un-folky, their angst and
dissonance was well suited to their
11:00 time slot and die inside of my
Mudhoney closed the big stage
last night The promoter only allowed
them to play half their set, so that he
would only have to pay them half their

I could write some fruity copy
about the quiet turmoil of finding an
empty Port-o-let, but I find this whole
story so far to be embarrassingly light
on substance so I will now just stare at
the glaring floodlights in the parking

door. I've counted seven demolished
theless, they posed relentlessly during
the fireworks display and inspired a
crowd of hungry headbangers to chant
"KISS!! KISS!! KISS!!" an hour later
in the second tent With the big money
festivities wrapping up at midnight,
the crowd was rabid for more.
The festival gave them 10 Days
Late (formerly Playhouse) from Vancouver. Call me partisan, but I think
they rocked the crowd out of
dissappointment 10 Days Late don't
tend to wimp out behind a thin curtain
of lousy attitudes and 'daring' cos-
can't remember the last time I heard a
member of an all mammary band say
(oh, I'm not saying it's a good thing)
"Go ahead and fuckin' MOSSHH."
They wanned the crowd up nice
for Porksword, who are from Saskatch-
ewan. These crazy guys had everyone
turning their heads to their buddy and
sayin' "I just gotta see them for the
Four bald guys with varying degrees of facial hair, sporting black satin
Johnny Cash blouses, got on stage and
belted out a happy medley of Black
Flag and Devo. This brutal and punishing sound kicked my primal urges into
overdrive, compelling me to lose all
rational decorum and submit to instinct I headed over to the dumpster
and got drunk.
Alcohol! The last great hope for
the socially challenged, my very last
drug of choice, completely free and
knee-deep accessable by this time
of the night (2:30), and certainly
not as much of a corporate push in
this year's festival as in the last one.
I nuzzle up to my surrogate boyfriend, the warm, throbbing generator, and swilled back two cool cans of
Black Ice, getting right into Porksword
with the help of the cloud of gas surrounding me. I select another full Pilsner
Hi-Can and go back into the tent.
Porksword are beginning to sound more
Killdozer inspired and I'm getting into
it even harder. I'm so full of courage I
go right into the mosh and smother
some confused arena rocker into submission. I slept alone.
Saturday, Aug. 14 7:30 pm
This is smack-dab in the middle ofthe
festival and that makes it the most
populated chunk, I'd imagine. The field
looks fairly sparse however, and the
looming debt sinks into the atmosfear.
I wish I could go off on some diatribe
about how I did coke with Mark Arm,
talked about politics with Bad Religion (cancelled) and hell, even twisted
oneupwithTommyChong(whothreat-
ened to steal all the Marshal's if he
did't get paid), but I'm just not that
cool and I guess that's reflected in the
people that eventually DO condescend
to talk to me:
Skater guy from Victoria: WeU, I
just don't know how to pick up chicks.
Me: Maybe you're just always going
after the wrong ones. What about all
those like, Sassy-type girts with the
bobbed hair and the baggy...
Skater: I TRIED those girls but they
just look at me like "what the fuck do
you wantT
Mf.Doyouknowevenwhatyouwant?
Skater: I just want to eat your pussy, I
just want to lick your clit.
Me: uhhh ,well, aaaaahk...
Skater: Would that turn you on if I
licked your clit?
Me: Well,mmmm... yeah, I guess so...
My Friend: Aw, he's for sure on a
Skater: No, I'm just being honest I
guess I'm not supposed to go and say
shit out loud like that, I guess you don't
like it Why don't you want me to eat
you out?
Me: Uh, I just don't get really turned
on by people...that I don't know, I
mean right now you're so easy...
Skater: O.K., O.K. yeah, I get it I just
really want to get laid...
Me: Hey, that giri over there, she
smiled at me but I bet she wants you.
Skater: Ah, hey I could score...aw I'm
not even that stoked, look she's goin
over to some stupid guy.
Me: You're right, she is.
Skater: They always go over to some
stupid guy.
Me: Bye!
The day rolled on. I saw nothing
in the program that would entice me
from just wandering around.
Of course, I found out around 5
pm that The Evaporators played at 2
pm. Why, why, WHY, do I manage to
catch all rucking FOUR ofthe Ripcordz
and Random Killing preformances, but
fail to see one of the six bands that I
could possibly get excited over out of
the 10,000-or-so bands I care nothing
The Muffs were the last band I
saw before I got dragged back home
and, thankfully, they were good.
So make your own ending up,
slag me for not being thorough, or just
weep yourself gently to sleep gently
while listening to your old Joy Division records: I'II most likely hang around
waiting for The Next Big Thing to
come along.
SEPTEMBER  Q Earlier this year I had the pristine
opportunity to witness the pride
of Alabama, Man Or Astro
Man?. Besides their astounding
live shows of instro-surf, several
televisions and shlocky stage
props, Man Or Astro Man? are
also dedicated to keeping their
fans' dental care in the upright
position. Aside from selling t-
shirts and records, they have their
very own patented "Teeth Paste"
so you can "put your Man Or
Astro Man where your mouth is."
Hey, I've been using it for three
months now; it's great stuff.
And now kids, you can have
special musical accompaniment
when teeth brushing, for
Nanaimo's Lance Rock Records
have just released a Man Or Ast ro
Man? EP entitled Supersonic Tooth -
brush Hel-
sort of way, OK? Oh, and for a
painful seven minutes, try reading the highly disturbing liner
notes on the inside sleeve. (One
Day I Stopped Breathing Records,
5321 7th Ave., NE, Seattle, WA,
98105, USA).
And from New York, the
Shrieking Violet* who are a
fun-filled, all-chick band who's
four-song EP starts out slightly
arty and then gets it all a really
rockin'. Shrieking Violets are like
the Muffs meets Jonie Mitchell
with strong "don't gimme no shit"
Big Apple vocals: tough stuff with
fun energy, especially on "Bad
Chinese Food". (Broken Rekkids,
P.O. Box 460402, SF.CA, 94146,
USA).
The only Canadian
gent  thi
tbe pop variety. The simple difference? A couple of good, catchy
tunes. It's a nice surprise, since
it's pretty rare for me to like anything out of the AmRep stable.
(Amphetamine Reptile Records,
2645 First Ave., S, Minneapolis,
MN, 55408, USA).
And for all the closet witches out
there, Sheffield, England's The
Mourning After have cackle-
out a spell-bindin' blast of '60's
garage-rauncb in the organ
drenched variety similar to like
minded Canadians like the
Haunted or the Worst. Although
completely retro, this stuff rocks
damn hard and manages to grow
on me (like a fungus) with each
play. Greg Garlic would love this!
(Merry Go-Round Records, Flat
One, 347 Queenstown Road, London, SW8 4LH England).
And for those of you who
like what I hate, go snag tbe
Don Caballero single
on Touch and Go.
InstruMENTAL noise-
dirge that bores me to
death. (Touch And Go,
P.O. Box 25520, Chicago,
IL, 60625, USA).
there tell me tbe name of
New York's kings of slop-
rock 'n' roll? If you

This time out the dukes of
draft-on-tap have done a
Northwest tribute single
for Estrus, poundin' out Paul Re-
) and the Raiders' "Louie Go
Home," and the Sonics' "Maintaining My Cool." "Louie" is
probably the most psychedelic
stuff you'll ever hear from these
ball bashers. As well, it's great
that "Maintaining" has finally
been given justice, as opposed to
the glaring anomaly that the
Marshmallow Overcoat
spewed out years ago on the
Sonics' tribute album. The
dead-on cover art take-off of
the Raiders' Here They
Come! album is hilarious as
well. Great record. (Estrus,
Box 2125, Bellingham, WA,
98227-2125, USA).
Anybody remember last
months rave review of local
metallists Thorsen and their
take on Viking Metal? Well,
here, folks, is the real thing...
direct from Boras, Sweden
comes S.L.R., a really dumb
metal combo. Harald, Lars, Peder,
sure. With the slowed down
"Skeletor" vocals and the major
metal finger fluttering, these
rock'n'roll warriors are a match
made by the gods for a split si ngle
with Thorsen. (Backadalsgatan
9A, 50254 Boras, Sweden).

tiling about it is the paper
bag, d.i.y. cover. (Buckshot
Records, 16136 Tukwilla Rd.,
Poulabo, WA, 98370, USA).
On a more posit ve chord, all
the way from Orlando, FL. comes
Red Bug, who's songs rollick
and roll with southern delight.
The a-side's "Blue Light Special"
is a country bop tune, soundin'
much like Seattle's Picketts or
Van's own Hard Rock Miners.
Whereas the b-side's "Downtown" depicts more of an R.E.M./
Y.F.F. jangle pop barrage. A nice
departure from all the gloomy
grunge I gotta listen to. (Canned
Corn Records, P.O. Box 2946,
Orlando, FLA, 32802-2946,
USA).
And finally, yet another
black vinyl slab from the "Gentlemen Of Rock And Roll"
Thee Headcoats. This single, entitled "We Hate The
Fuckin' NME," is in reference
to an article that appeared in
Britain's New Music Express
which "awarded" Thee
Headcoats with the title of
"Wannabe Inflammatory But
Can't Quite Pull It Off Pathetic
Pop Persona Of Idiot '60's Revivalists." Whew, quite a
mouthful! Class-A punk Billy
Childish leads his Headcoats
on a counter-attack with a
poundin' two chord emotional
slam-fest, spitting on the UK
rag. Over on the b-side, the men
pull an about-face to let drummer Bruce Brand take over to
do his best Peter Sellers impression (circa tbe BBC's Goonies)
while singing the Beatles'
"Help!": totally pathetic and
totally brilliant. The most impressive thing about this single
must be the back cover's liner
notes, where it lists all of Thee
Headcoats' record labels: 17(!)
different labels in total, spanning eight different countries
world-wide! And if that ain't
worth some positive press and
respect in their own country, I
fail to know what is! (Damaged
Goods, P.O. Box 671, London,
E17 6NF, England).

,  Ala-
tmm
bama style.
And as
is with all
Astro gear,
the four songs are interspersed
with humorous b-movie samples,
all laced up in a brilliant colourful
package. So for a more peppy,
brighter (and younger) version of
some of the more familiar Canadian instro bands, catch a breaker
southbound to the anti-cavity,
floss-beat of Man Or Astro Man?
Oh, and be sure to seek out the LP
on Estrus. (Lance Rock Records,
1223 College Dr., Nanaimo, BC,
V9R 5Z5).

have so much trouble describing.
I could use several easy cop-out

throw some "angst" in there... hell,

though the "fuzzed out" vocal effect backfires, making the vocals
sound more muffled than the intentional distortion. All-in-all,
they are catchy and hep, they've
even got the screamin' KurtBloch

Old Man are a group from
Seattle who play mediocre pop of
the punk variety and have failed
to impress me too much on this

Eric's Trip
Six Finger Satellite
The Town Pump
Thursday July 29
I despise keeping people in suspense,
so as backwards as it may be, I'll
give you my conclusion now: GOOD
SHOW!
I missed Six Finger Satellite (I
know, bad reviewer, bad!) but I
managed to catch some tasty morsels about them from the crowd.
Apparently the band felt up members of the audience as well as each
other. The drummer power-puked.
The music was called "artsy", "layered" and "White trash, cowboy-
assed, wierdo shit."
As Eric's Trip launched into
their set, I walked into the Pump.
The air was charged with a voluminous powerbuzz Uke the hum of a
transformer station. This tension
periodically warped itself into a
squeal of feedback and discordant
guitar. Despite this intense undercurrent, the feel was very dreamlike.
This atmosphere was enhanced by
the stage lighting, just two yellow
lightbulbs on the floor. Simple, but a
nice change from the usual gaudy
overhead multiple coloured lights.
The whole deal was nicely offset by
bassist Julie Doirnon's wait-like
voice, which matches well with Rick
White's tremoring vocals.
I was reluctantly jolted out of
this trance-like state by the energetic power-pop-punk presence of
Portland's Pond. Guitarist-vocalist
Charlie looked almost impossibly
joyful as he bounced around the
stage, reminding me of a Dr. Seuss
character, while bassist/voice guy
Chris, energetically wielding his
bass, nearly took off my nose.
Although I was personally
more into Eric's Trips' trip, I was
quite impressed with the passion,
enthusiasm, and tuneful talents of
Pond. And since this was the last
show on the tour, we were treated to
a bit of on stage anarchy, as they
chucked around their guitars and
mangled the drum kit. Then again,
maybe they just didn't want to do an
Jules D.
The Town Pump
Saturday July 29th
It was a dull so
filled me as I entered the Town Pump,
unexplainably nervous, I sipped on
a Long Island double. I was more
than early and therefore nabbed a
table on the raised seating area right
next to the speaker (my ears regretted this choice for days). Pure's
guitarist Todd Simko was hustling
about and putting the finishing
touches on the lights.
About two hours later Moist
wandered confidently on the stage
and I let out a low sigh, thinking that
it would be yet another hour until
things would start to get interesting.
Singer David Usher's emotional
vocals...magical. Moist is definitely
a performance-oriented band, and
they enraptured the young audience.
As they neared their inevitable end I
was left wondering, what could possibly top this?
By the time Pure strolled on
stage, the audience was boiling. Lead
singer Jordy Birch's stage style has
changed considerably over the past
couple of months, before me now
stood a more determined, aggressive performer. Yet strangely, he
failed to hold my attention, almost
fading into the background. He remained, for the most part, focused
on the back of the wall, ignoring the
crowd behind him.
Two burly bouncers andatech-
guy were draggi ng people out of the
audience and pushing them across
the stage. Simko and bassist Dave
Hadley (who, incidentally, sported
the coolest pair of long-johns),
seemed incredibly cramped, as they
did their trademark tandem bouncing.
For the most part Pure gave
the crowd a tightly knit, high-energy
performance. The high point of the
evening came at the very end with a
coverversionof Kiss' "RockV Roll
All Night." Unfortunately they
fucked it up, someone stopped playing and it all just ended abrupty.
However, the audience couldn't care
less as they were too fully entangled
in the Pure experience.

Shades of Culture
The Town Pump
Sunday, August 1st
"Black men shouldn't play that kind
of music"- one Vancouver restaurant employee's response to a description of Bad Brains.
When I first heard this bone-
gender or culture; for example, Bad
Brains plays an incredibly powerful
mix of reggae and punk while their
lyrics reflect their religious inspiration. That there aren't many other
all-black bands playing this type of
music does not mean that the band is
trying to fit into a genre that is not
their own...rants over, now on with
the review.
The Town Pump got rocked
August 1 st harder than I' ve ever seen
it get rocked before. Being the unreliable degenerate that I am, I missed
the first two bands so you' 11 just ha ve
to let your imagination go. But those
Didjits... Was it me or was the lead
singeratongue-flicking moron whose
annoying stage antics nullified his
headed remark I was really pissed
off, and then it got me thinkin'. I
started thinkin' about popular conceptions of punk rock and "black
music" and how Bad Brains subverts and confuses all these "popular conceptions." Musicians
shouldn't be relegated to a certain
type of music strictly based on their
ftancid photo by Trish Kely
bands' potential? Besides having a
wanker for a lead singer, the Didjits
suffered as any mediocre-to-good
band would from having to open for
those Washington D.C. kings of in-
your-face punk-reggae-rock Bad
Brains who were mesmerizing.
This was just one of those
shows you had to see to understand.
Vinyl, cassette, CD and written attempts to recreate the Uve energy
that is Bad Brains have all failed.
The new lead vocalist belted out old
songs and soon-to-be-released
tracks. He dispelled those nasty rumours what that he is not as good as
H.R.. In fact, the crowd took instantly to worshipping him.
A good thrashy pit brewed up,
but again, it'd be nice to see more
women bouncing around and stage
diving. (I' mone to talk, I stood in the
shadows in awe.) The cherry on top
of this decadent Sunday evening was
the story of the new lead vocalist
taking pity on my ticketless friend
and walking him in, saying as they
passed a beefy doorman: "He's with
me." Lovely man. Lovely show.

Sinister Six
The Off Ramp, Seattle
Tuesday, August 3rd
I love the Muffs. So they didn't play
in Vancouver? But they did play in
Seattle with the Didjits AND Sinis-
terSix! Bullocks toall those chumps
who had to pay a Bad Brains-Bad-
Dreadlocked-type ticket price to see
the Didjits! Get this, I got to go to
Seattle, "hang," see three rockin'
bands, and it was all for free!
Tlie Sinister Six played a
slightly uninspired set of
(dreadlocked!?!) garage mania,
reminiscent of Girl Trouble and the
Supersuckers, but with the charisma
of neither.
Tlie Muffs came on! Wliooaa,
I'ma lucky guy! Two sassy, rockin'
chicks and two semi-rockin' guys
(what tlie hell happened to original
Muffs' drummer Criss Crass, by the
way?) who tore up the stage with all
the amazing pop gems leader Kim
Shattuck has penned so ruggedly
into hits. Oooo... this band is good.
Her raucous screams got a Uttle bit
on my nerves, but I guess I can live
willi that.
After a couple more
margaritas and lager, I witnessed the
Didjits: one guy (Rick, lead singer,
guitarist, song writer, brain) totally
into it, and two bangers on bass and
drums along for the ride. Or at least
tliat was my perception of the sight
before mine eyes. They rocked hard,
you know, punk, but it was a Muffs

Red Sugar
Compression 1010
Saturday, August 7th
It was late, almost 3AM, at the after
hours joint and Red Sugar (the third of
three bands) still appeared oo the stage.
I was hanging by the door, kind of
bored and depressed, too tired to real) y
make a decision, which was the only
reason why I hadn' t already gone home
and gone to sleep. The ongoing conversation was about how ROCK
MUSIC wasn't so much dead in the
1990's as just not fresh anymore.
Suddenly, there's apoct on stage
making weird birdcall sounds that
to do with mating rituals and male
sexual energy, I believe). He's getting
louder and more aggressive every second, and Red Sugar are filing on stage
behind him, plugging their guitars in
and malting free-form noise, rising in
intensity as the poet climaxes and finally stumbles off the front ofthe stage
into the sparse front-room crowd. Red
Sugar meanwhile have taken this as
their cue and kick into a BIG psychedelic wall of melodic noise that's
riding asolid groove and dropping just
enough folky twang to remind us what
This goes on for a long, long
time before the noise subsides a bit and
there's room for a few vocals, big
serious words about God and the human soul and other vital concerns.
Needless to say, I'm well into A.
The song keeps chugging along,
repetitive, loud and true, and suddenly
I remember a friend last seen chilling
out in another part of the party. I go
looking for him. He doesn't want to
leave his comfortable seat, but I even-
tuallyconvincehimthattheRedSugar
experience is not to be missed; we
head back to the main room where the
first song is still happening, just in time
for the last chorus and final climactic
blow out The small crowd is apprecia-
ti ve. They make a lot of noise.
The second song is a cover:
Roger Millar's "King of the Road"
(ya, that one - the hobo anthem). Red
Sugar do it raw, good-natured justice.
I am very impressed and by this point
energized enough to realize how tired
I really am, so as they start their third
song, I finally split the party. Rock
may not be fresh anymore, but it certainly is not dead. It's not even sleeping. Red Sugar are very cool, maybe
even godlike. I suspect I will see them
again soon.
Swervedriver
Rock City
Nottingham, England
Saturday, August 7
A dnimmer makes all the difference,
and I'm not saying that just because I
live with one. If anyone remembers
the faroe that was Swervedriver's premiere Vancouver performance (openers Poster Children stole the stage and
the crowd's respect from under their
upturned noses), they'll know that the
band that stumbled its way through an
incomprehensible set that night was an
incomplete and uninspired melee of
musicians and technicians (the sound
e ngineer). Fortunately, tonight the band
was in its homeland and therefore had
the same time. Swervedriver played
host on the bottom floor and a packed
crowd of, oh, let's say, 200-300 people. Thxat figure is kind of disheartening consideri ng Heine ken draught was
flowing freely for 1 pound. Even more
troubling was the fact that a larger
portion of people showed up afler the
performance to dance to the likes of
Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic
Youth and other North American
"coalige roack" sensations.
What did these people miss?
TheymissedSwervedriverintopform.
The majority of the band's material for
the evening was from their forthcoming record (the "Duel" single is out as
you read this), complemented by old
faves Uke "Rave Down." Sadly, some
of their best songs ("Son of Mustang
Ford," "Pileup," "Never Lose That
Feeling Again" and "Sandblasted")
were never even hinted at Although
Swervedriver can be a powerful and
original Uve act, it takes more than
hints from their Uve performance to
clue us into the genius that they can
conjure in the studio.

The Forge
Portland, Or
Saturday August 7/8
We left for Portland all fuzzyheaded in
the early morning, sipping black coffee, while rushing down the 1-5. The
Forge is in an abandoned, dilapidated
industrial sideof Portland. Westoodin
this snakey, slow line-up as each person was frisked and wristbanded before being released into the concert
shack. Just before I got too bored, we
hear some yelling and the crowd of
punkish kids that had previously been
hanging out rushed the gates, demanding to be let in. The bouncers
didn't take too kindly to this display,
and a loud, somewhat violent ruckus
The punks claimed to be squatters from Hollywood who travelled to
Portland in a porcelain white pickup
with Jiffy markings. They also claimed
to have no money for tickets. They had
great dyed hair, tattoos, piercings,
leather jackets.boots and beer in seeming abundance, so they felt that the
gate should just admit them for free.
Come on kids! What did you expect?
That 24 bands would play for
FREE????(although,itwould'vebeen
After more pushing and yelling,
we found ourselves (squatters included) inside the show and catching
the last few songs of MDC. The show
atmosphere was a spectacle: punks
enjoying the continuous circular slam
pit, complete with fearless stage diving. Some guy jumped from the speaker
stack, but when the crowd shifted, he
hit the concrete floor.
Thebands we DID see included:
Butt Trumpet (my favourite);
Guttermouth, and a bunch of funny
skater guys hurting beersinto the audience (their bassist eventually puked
onstage and just walked off in the
middle of a number). The White Trash
Debutantes dragged guys onstage to
dance in their underwear or less, cul-
minati ng in one of the recruits taking a
leak on the other guys and al] over the
stage. The Dayglo Abortions got a
huge response. DI and reunited oldies
Channel 3 completed the show, which
the cops shut down at midnight.
We missed the second day with
DOA and others, but according to
reUable sources that did make it there
(they could make it anywhere! -ed)
informed us that the promoter's girlfriend tried to rip off all of the proceeds
collected from ticketAeer sales. Apparently those big bouncers were all
over her and later (under police supervision) destroyed the promoter's
Caddy as retaliation far the attempted
ripoff that could have left both bouncers and bands unpaid Whew!!

just might rule in mine as well. Ofthe

one band that didn't qualify as great at

The afternoon outdoor concert/
skate jam got off to a loud start with
local hardcore boys Strain. Both the
openness and reverb (courtesy of the
soundman and nearby buildings)
complimented singer Jody Taylor's
booming voice and proved that Strain's
sound is well suited to such outdoor
venues. The band was tight and Jody is
slowly overcoming his shyness with
the crowd as he actually managed to
tell us the names of the songs for once.
Rotorcloud representing the
"modern rock" genre, were pretty
poppy but not overly so. They were
almost as apologetic for their inability
to skate as cub, the next band on the
bill were.
Cub's performance gave way to
some obvious tension on stage and a
noticeable increase in tempo, which
seemed to confuse cub's drummer.
I'm not sure if they wanted to finish
their set quickly or if they felt that the
music should match the speed of the
skaters who continued to "jam" on the
street below, but what we heard was
speed cuddle cere. Nevertheless, cub
was an appropriate rep for Vancouver
giri bands (you decide if that's good or
bad).
BNU, the best suburban punk
band in town, followed with a set of
catchy tunes that were very pleasing to
Ihe ear. The guitarist's facial expressions were almost as amusing as the
gyratin' singer who, in his great wisdom, convinced every meathead to
put down his board (but not his beer!)
and slam into other meatheads. BNU's
singer had created a moshing monster
and by the time Berkley' s Rancid took
the stage, stupidity had pretty well
taken over.
Rancid's bassist made his fingers fly at lightning speed and left me
contemplating exactly how many incarnations it will take me to reach that
level of skill. These boys definitely
have the punk rock thing down pat,
I went away from this show
satisfied and thankful to the NFAers
for a day which cost me nothing and
gave me so much.

DUB SYNDICATE
Live at the T&C
(On-U Sound)
BURNING SPEAR
The World Should Know
(Heatbeat)
Two of the best reggae bands
have just provided listeners with
new releases: a live album from
a band that rarely performs live,
and a studio disc by one that
tours relentlessly. Give praise!
Recorded Uve at the Town
and Country Club in London,
Dub Syndicate prove that they
are every bit as good on stage as
they are in the studio. This 1991
incarnation of the On-U house
band consists of Roots Radics
drummer Style Scott,
percussionist Talvin Singh,
Junior Moses on bass, Carl
Gentles on keyboards and
guitarists Renford Bailey and
Skip MacDonald, formerly of
Tackhead.
Reggae crooner Bim
Sherman lays down some soulful
vocals. He is joined by the vocal
trio Akabu and Lee Perry, who's
voice is mixed into a version of
Secret Laboratory Dub even
though he wasn't at the gig.
Credit must also be given to
Adrian Sherwood who's mixing
and dubbings help make Live at
the T <_ C a most enjoyable
recording.
On Burning Spear's latest,
The World Should Know,
Winston Rodney sings "music is
what I have, music is what I
...the me
ic,  the i
ssage l
i  the
message," and this pretty well
sums up the Burning Spear creed.
Since 1969 Burning Spear
has been spreading the word,
refining the riddums and
entertaining reggae fans from the
stage. Check out the Live In Paris
recording and/or video if you
have yet to catch them in the
flesh. While not all that much is
different from the last couple of
releases, The World Should
Know is a fair offering from
Winston and the Burning Band.
It is a good place to start if you
are unfamiliar with the band and
their music.
Both Dub Syndicate and
Burning Spear represent the best
in today's roots reggae music.

MOIST
Motet
(Independent)
I was first introduced to the
sounds of Moist in a backward
manner. A member ofthe band
accompained by a MOIST
sticker. A congenial guy, he
couldn't resist the opportunity to
self-promote.  I Ustened half-
Yes, Moist is heavily
influenced by Peart Jam, The
Red Hot Chili Peppers and
several other bands that are just
dangling on the edge of my
tongue. Memories flow freely
when the guitar, or keyboards
hit a seris of familiar notes but
this is all part of the music's
enchanment.
Lead singer David Usher's
voice is the strong point here,
full of such energy and honest,
driving emotion that just pulls
you right in and wraps you up. In
particular, the keyboards make
the most difference on this tape,
adding the necessary spice in the
otherwise guitar oriented music.
Favorite tracks of mine include
the harsh and sensual "Push,"
the emotional "Believe Me,"
"Kid Conductor" and "Picture
Elvis."
It's unfortunate that Moist
is not released on CD, for then it
would be far less timeconsuming
to repeat a song over and over
and over again.

impressed with the physical

"That boy was born with the

Indeed, Moist is comprised
of five very handsome young

of creativity.
The latter being
case, however, as

base and continue
on in high spirits,
now a shallow
mockery of
themselves (pick any band from
the 70's or, Heaven forbid, the
60's which are still around - the
Rolling Stones will do). The
artist displays a misinterpreted
sense of achievement and an
uncanny will (pick any band from
the 70's or 60's which is stiU
around - the Rolling Stones will
suffice again).
Take,  for instance,  Van

i Halen is an
ing example for a couple
reasons: Van Halen chose to step
outside their musical confines
not once, but twice (as stated
above, most learn the first time).
Their first backward
advance came with the release
of the Diver Down album:
seemingly superscribed by the
band's lead vocalist, David Lee
Roth (we'U get to him later),
Diver Down misrepresented Van
Halen as a group when, in fact,
the album was actually born of
Roth's wet dreams. Featuring
very few origi nal tunes, and even
more Jazz/Motown/Country
covers like "Big Bad Bill (is
Sweet William Now)" (with
Edward and Alex's dad guesting
on clarinet), "Dancing in the
Streets" and "Happy Trails," Van

their heads â€” but happy that
there was still

NOMEANSNO
Why Do They Call Me Mr.
Happy?
(Alternative Tentacles)
Norn
fanat
trill
undoubtedly find Why Do They
Call Me Mr. Happy ? as satisfying
as any oftheir efforts, but for me
Nomeansno peaked on Wrong
wisdom, then V<
Halen
omniscient: the
1984 LP was
released and, yes,
it had keyboards.
This time the final
product was a
bastard child oft he
band's two heavyweight egos:
David Lee Roth
and Edward Van
Halen.
Edward had come into his
own as a guitar deity, but he was
looking to expand on his
virtuosity (finding that
expansion in keyboards, his first
attempt spawned a number one
hit: "Jump.") and David... well,
David was just David (we'll get
to him later). Misconstruing that
number one hit as a green light
for further keyboard
compositions, enter 5150, exit
David Lee Roth, and enter
Sammy Hagar.
Now this brings us to an
even more interesting offshoot
in the compromise/desist
creativity theory. Whereas most
bands would have interpreted the
waning success of Diver Down
and 1984, in comparison to the
high watermark standards of
their first three LPs as signalling
an imminent break-up album,
Van Halen chose to shuffle their
Une-up.
The flamboyant and
audacious David Lee Roth
was served the pink slip to
further pursue his
meanderings in Beach
Boys' covers, Hair Club for
Men recruitment and larger-
than-Ufe libido exorcisms,
while Sammy "I Can't
Drive 55" Hagar took up
the vocal chores for Van
Halen and their staunch (but
dwindUng) fans.
The music world was
n subject to not only
but t
iclui
i that
were wrong with the initial
equation  -  nobody  ever
liked Sammy, and they soon
learned to hate David.
But what does all this have
to do with Superconductor's Hit
Songs For Girls you ask?
Absolutely nothing, except for
the fact that Superconductor has
probably made the best pop
album of the year, including a
great Poppy Family-cum-
Smashing     Pumpkins-cum-
and have not attained that level
of energy since then.
Like any Nomeansno
album, there are moments on Mr.
Happy which demonstrates the
band's ability to provide
incredibly tight energetic bursts.
But these moments are buried by
overindulgent 'musicianship'
which is found on ofthe rest of
the record.

Altered Beast
(Zoo)
Despite what the record
company's ad for this album
would have you believe, Altered
Beast is more than a "dinosaur
act" collection of the talents of
an "all-star cast" of guitar pop's
past masters. No indeed, it is
First and foremost, Altered
Beast is a collection of truly fine
pop songs. Period. Sure, thegreat
guest musicians don't hurt -
check out Robert Quine's
wailing, tear-jerking guitar solo
in "Devil with the Green Eye"â€”
but they're essentially just icing
on the cake.
And what a cake it is:
ingenius and deceptively simple
pop hooks that reach out and
grab you and won't let you go;
angry power chords and
scorching death blues bravado;
sweet, subtle melodies that all
but drive you to tears;
arrangements that are layered
without being busy; and lyrics
that brim with emotional
intensity.
Matthew Sweet achieves
sentiment without syrup, angst
without whininess, anger without
machismo, and melancholy
without mercy. Hell, it's so good
that I got a freebee and then
bought it anyway!
The god of pop lives,
BELIEVE!!!!

PENNYWISE
Unknown Road
(Epitaph)
Clean chords, thick energy,
powerful vocals, this second
offering from Pennywise (from
Hermosa Beach, CA â€” the same
town as punk legends Black Flag
and the Descendants) keeps the
sound sharp, quick and loud.
Throughout Unknown
Road, Penny wise urge us to "start
giving your best" and remind us
that "it's your life.". Don't get
me wrong, their heart is in the
right place, but after fourteen
tracks,this urging becomes, well
how you say... nagging. Good
message, and lots of it.
Individually, tracks like
"Homesick," "Clear Your Mind"
and "Dying to Know" reveal
what Pennywise is all about:
fresh, driving rock.
It's worth noting that these
up and coming no-school punk
rockers have already had their
music featured in various surf/
skate/snowboard videos (not to
mention an ad in the latest
Transworld)!
Penny wise are off to a good
start. However, it remains to be
seeniftheirtight, squeaky-clean
sound comes off in a live
performance. Stay tuned.

TRANCE MISSION
Trance Mission
(City of Tribes)
from San Francisco." I
have no idea if the four
members of this group
are from Oz, but it sure
sounds as though
someone was foolish
enough to lug a couple
of Korgs to Ayer's Rock.
Trance Mission play a
lot     of     traditional
a didgeridoo â€” that
thing that makes that
spring-like sound. They
even use instruments
I've never heard of such as
riqqigub-gubbi, kaytals, p'iri,
khaen, kalimba, and a bodhran.
Sounds like they come from the
Klingon dictionary, don't they?
Now, is it good? That's
beyond me.
Maybe if I lived in the
outback and took inducive trips
to the dreamland and played
W.C. Bull Roaper I'd understand
SEPTEMBER   Â© it.   Right  now,   though,   its
comparable to stuff you might
find on the Extreme label. That's
as close as I'm gonna get.

FUGAZI
In on the kill taker
(Dischord)
The name Fugazi is synonymous
to uncompromising hardcore
punk rock. After all these years,
and numerous indie-label
albums, In on the Kill Taker
continues to thrill me. It's no
surprise that Fugazi's influence
is prevalent in newer bands such
as Quicksand and Paw.
After listening to the 12
heavy and intense songs on this
album, I felt a bit psychologically
disturbed, which is an indication
of a well made album.
All the elements that make
up Fugazi are present: loud and
sick-sounding guitars, angry
vocals, and a tight rhythm
section. Togetherthey sound Uke
melodious cacophony.
I strongly recommend this

U.R.G.E. OVERKILL
Saturation
(Geffen)
In a vastly improved world,
U.R.G.E. Overkill would be
bigger than both REM. and U2.
The carefree, coffee-and-pie vibe
exuded by this Chicago trio
would be the teen spirit of the
day. No need for any band's
harsh social and poUtical tirades,
no calls to save the rain forests -
only cool nffs and more martinis:
Alas, Saturation is
probably not destined to sell
several million copies, but it is
U.R.G.E.'s best record to date.
Unlike the loungy and uneven
Stull E. P., Saturation reUes more
on the band's
considerable pop
prowess.
Add an obvious, yet
flawless, tastein seventies
rock (I hear vintage KISS,
Cheap Trick, Bowie and
more!) and some punk
chops, and the result is an
album that rocks
loud'n'proud.
Here's to hopin' the
boys can afford premium
vodka in those martinis
Sean Harvey
THE DOUGHBOYS
Crush
(A&M)
Stealing melodies from songs
heard on mid-eighties LG 73 isn' t
usually a good way to begin an
album. The Doughboys do this
on Crush, but that's not to say
they're a top 40 band. With their
generally rock-radio tunes, t hese
guys could make it big in Canada
Unfortunately, the album
features many songs that are
relatively indistinguishable from
one another (yes, even after only
one listening). It' s listenable, but
I can't say that it's worth buying
except maybe for the cover art
work, which could easily entice
unsuspecting shoppers.
Sometimes sounding Uke
Drivin' And Cryin' or Soul
Asylum (whose current album I
would give the same criticisms),
the Doughboys could stand some
wrwTr aMpMiW
kneading. This aside, the songs
"End of the Hall" and "Shine"
are kinda catchy, but after
hearing a few ofthe songs, the
rest ofthe songs sound identical.
It may very well be that this
is the kind of CD that grows on
you after about 5 or more
playings, but for now I' U have to
keep it in the back of my mind
and hopefully go back to Crush
at some later date.
Brian Wieser
DAVID  SYLVAIN  and
ROBERT FRIPP
The Firet Day
(Virgin)
Imagine yourself lying in a boat,
drifting down a river on a
summer's day. They sky is blue,
there's a gentle breeze, and 77ie
First Day would be quietly
playing as accompaniment.
I've puttered around
cleaning my apartment to
this, as well as having a
nice doze on the couch.
If you're familiar with
either Japan or David
Sylvain's solo work, you
know not to expect
anything jarring; Sylvain
warbles in his
unmistakeable voice in a
most relaxing fashion.
Robert Fripp, a guitarist
that has worked with Brian
Eno, doesn't intrude into
the mix, even though he
does do some wanking.
"20th Century Dreaming"
(a shaman's song) and
"Darshan" (the road to
graceland) take up one entire
side; the songs could certainly
use some trimming, however, the
album is lush aural experience.
June Scudeler
FUNLAND
Sweetneee
(Arista)
Funland is pop music with heavy
guitars and drippy melodies that
would normally strike one as
extremely cheezy (especially
considering the Air Supply
cover) but Sweetness is, instead,
profoundly satisfying.
From start to finish,
Funland provide one ofthe most
solid pop-rock efforts that I have
heard in years.
Tom Milne
Paul Westerberg
14 Songs
(Sire)
WeU, here's the Paul album... all
we need to do is wait a couple of
weeks for the Slim Dunlap CD
to come out and all of us
Replacements freaks will be able
to rate each ofthe band members'
solo efforts against one another.
So far, Chris Mars rocks.
Tommy Stinson's Bash & Pop
is, well, whatever; now it' s Paul' s
turn at the plate. Technically,
most would call this his second
solo CD, counting All Shook
Always considered a more
literate songwriter than the
'Mats' style would let on, Paul
plays it to the hilt on 14 Songs.
These songs, while pretty good
(better than I could write), are
just a litde too self-indulgent for
my liking, as is both the fake
Westerberg novel on the cover
and the numerous photos of
himself inside.
Not to say 74 Song* is crap,
though; I mean, it's no Sting
album or anything. "Knockin'
on Mine," "First Glimmer" and
other songs do demonstrate that
Westerberg can write enjoyable
songsâ€” "Black Eyed Susan,"
the best track, was done in his
kitchen lo-fi and Paul's vocals
are terrific. However, there is no
evidence ofthe fun and rawness
that the Replacements once had.
This album provides
support for the theory that Capt.
Kirk, Spock and McCoy were
three facets of a single being;
it's obvious that if the best parts
of Mars', Stinson's and
Westerberg's (and possibly
Dunlap's?) albums were
combined, we would have one
hell of a record.

SIX FINGER SATELLITE
The Pigeon is the Moet
Popular Bird
(Sub Pop)
Six Finger Satellite's new release
sounds neat, and I don't quite
know howwhat to say or how to
describe it.
From the catchy neo-disco/
noise of Laughing Larry, to the
odd soundscapes between each
of the songs, Jeremiah Ryan's
often distorted, always
aggressive vocals caught my
attention as one ofthe Satellite's
strongest points. Also, I felt that
ten actual songs of the 21 tracks
were well suited by having
eleven surrounding tracks of
noise to make for a fairly strong
CD. Most of it sounds Uke music
on an elevator to hell - but I
mean that in a good way.

MOFO'S PSYCHOSONIC PIX
Hey there, U'l campers! You know,
there is a difference between Us-
tening to these goofy little platters
I mention and devoting an entire
night of your Ufe to dancing to
them. I saw an enormous line of
people outside of the Commodore
on 'Disco Nite' the other nite and
just shook my head in pity. It seems
there is an ever growing number of
people who lack a life inthis 'burg.
Now, fine, ifyou get a charge
out of putting on one of the rare
grooves hke "Get the Funk Outa
My Face" (Bros. Johnson) or "Boogie Fever" (Sylvers) for a gag (I
know I do), but to shake your sorry
ass for a whole evening of some of
the most heinous tunage in record-
32 E_f^Â«GÂ£n_I_7-3
ed history just to either get pissed
cheaply or make a pathetic attempt to
get laid, puts you amongst the culturally challenged â€” hke the peoph
who watch Studs or who are mem
bers of the Reform Party.
Sorry to bring it up, but I don'
want you to get the idea that I, Mofo,
would condone that sort of life-style
(the music, not the drinking and getting laid parts) just because I inform
you of the few good (or the craziest)
disco plates there are! As I've said
before. I can't beheve that there are
so many jokers out there listening to
music their parents liked.
You've probably heard about
the developing crusade against used
CD shops in the U.S. Now, I'm all for
forcing shop owners to pay royalties to a group that can get the
moolah to the performers, but hearing Garth Brooks (who's sold more
records than Canada has Uving humans) pout 'n' whine about losing
money somehow doesn't get my
sympathy.
Anyway, on to the auditory
poison I call the Psych opsonic Psix-
pak!! I've added a genre description as well to help you peg the
record's style. Lemme
know what you think
This past month I got a
lotta seven inchers this
time from the fine shops
on Hastings St., like:
SONNY
"Laugh   At   Me"/
"Tony"
(Atco)
Wow! A very bitter
$onny starts off by dedicating the song to his
critics andtoCher, singing the equivalent of
"I'mrubber and you're
glue, etc." The music is
total Neil Diamond "I
Am, I Said"- type, big drum stuff.
The record was so overplayed it
had this very eerie distortion quality to it. Quite unsettUng stuff.
GENRE: Celebrity schmaltz
CHEEZABILITY RATING: 89
AL GILBERT
"Grade 7 Honky Tonk Tap" /
"Grade 3 Song & Tap"
(Training Aid)
Tap trauma courtesy Al et al. You
have no idea how awful these 45's
truly are until you hear 'em. Al
i overtop a piano
that's extremely out of tune, and the
tapper is completely off time. If all
tap records are Uke this, no wonder
it's a dead art.
GENRE: Educational jollies
CHEEZABILITY RATING: 86
SANDPIPERS (featuring the
Mitch Miller Orchestra)
Farmyard Friends
(Golden)
MITCHELL AYERS
"Number 7 Theme"
(No. 7)
I found two copies of this seven inch
at the same store! One fo the songs
main attraction is that Bill Baker &
company put it on their "50 Cent
Record Hour" compilation! Other
letters I've gotten from the lower
mainland mentioned it, too. It's as if
it was only distributed around Vancouver. Could this have been an
experiment in subUminal suggestion? I dunno, but after listening to
this, I sure could use a smoke.
GENRE: Promotional
CHEEZABILITY RATING: 80
BANJO BARONS
Happy Days Are Here Again!
(Vocalion LP)
I'm a sucker for a good banjo orchestra! There are about a dozen of
'em here doing all the usual banjo
stuff with a ragtime lean. What more
can I say?
***3 COMPLBTr.
This seven inch comes with a cool
oversize sleeve that some indie band-
should make for their releases. It
really sticks out. Farmyard Friends
is actually a compilation 45's of three
previously released singles: "Little
Pig Polka," "ittle White Duck" and
"The Animals of Farmer Jones." And
you thought only indie labels did
this! Groovy story/songs about barnyard fun.
GENRE: Children's tales
CHEEZABILITY RATING: 90
THE PICK O' THE MONTH
THE GOLDEN HEIR SINGERS
Talkin' About Love
(Master)
This LP comes from Master, the
folks that brought you the Tex
Yearoutâ€”the record I mentioned
early this year. Yup, more Jesus
stuff. The Golden Heirs come from
ChilUwack, and are about the squares! cats you've ever seen! This album is full of all the uncomfortable
sexual allusions all these fervent
Christian discs seem to have, as
well as the shifting of responsibility
from oneself to God for one's actions. It's also kinda weird to hear a
preppy trio sing about "flesh hanging off Job" in a peppy way. Best 75
cents I spent this month!!!
GENRE: 12 Inches of Jesus
CHEEZABILITY: 95
_"**       ing out. By the way,
keep sending me those
tapes' n' stuff; I'm hoping to do a Psampler of
reader's pix by December (knock wood!).
Until then, you'll have
to be satisfied with one
of my first two Psam-
plers. Just drop me a
Une (and $5/tape), a
stamp or two and your

THE NEWEST - THE COOLEST - THE ZULUEST
Tar
â€¢ Toast
Pulverising riffs, churning bass
and a stop start precision that
envelops you, picks you up and
then slams you down, only to do
it all over again and again and
again. It feels soooooo good!
lhat's Tar's Toast.
IMPORT (available mid sept)

Yo La Tengo
â€¢ Shaker
Hoboken New Jersey's finest. A
critics band, so sign up now. A
simple, three-song sample of what
good songwriting and a pure heart
IMPORT

Jesus Lizard
â€¢ Lash
A long-time favorite, the Lizard
lash out with this new El'. Using a
studio/stage combo release, it's a
tease of sorts, but these guys are
psycho-freaks and this record will
do some serious damage.

â€¢ Hit Songs for Girls
1 first heard it on a beach, then in
a fast car, then my best friend told
me about it. Now I wanna tell you
about it, 'cos 1 know it's what you
need, what we all need. A sunny
ray on a bad day, and then some.
Hey, these are hit songs for
everyone.

Unrest
Â® Perfect Teeth
For all you Crest kids, worried
about the decay of pop culture.

an easy smile with another
sample of deftly-crafted songwriting and worry-free jangles.

Pennywise
â€¢ Unknown Road
Another in the long line of punk
rock smash releases on Epitaph
Records, Unknown Road picks up
where Pennywise left off with
their previous self-titled release. If
you rock to Bad Religion, you
should get Pennywise.
IMPORT
U.98cd/9.98cass
Stereolab
â€¢ Transient
Fueled by their Moog grooves,
angelic vocals, and spacey
guitars, the Lab again weather
themselves from the realm of
banal English dream pop. A long
player guaranteed to spin you to
the moon!

Breeders
â€¢  Cannonball
Another batch of breathy pop
songs from the Deal twins.
Following last year's Safari, this
one starts with a bang and floats
over the three-rings below. Cotton
candy not included.

Boss Hog
Â® girl+
A strident release! of bluesy jazzy
noise that just rocks. Propelled by
the sultry vocals of Cristina and
the off-cuff blues licks of Jon
Spencer, girl+ makes some crazy
moves and locks you into the
perfect groove. Boss Hog! thank
you very much.

IMPORT BLOW-OUT!
Zulu needs to clear out some
stock to make room for a new
pile of stuff. We stayed up all
night to mark down hundreds
of hard-to-find and one-of-
a-kind cds. The prices have
been slashed, most 50% off
their regular Zulu price. Look
for the yellow-ish stickers
throughout the store. You
won't see many of these
titles ever again, so move
fast or get left behind.
