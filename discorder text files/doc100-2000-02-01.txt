DiSCORDER Who are you?
Siobhan DuVall Lately around
town we are the lovely Miss Siobhan
DuVall on guitar and vocals, Gabe
Cipes (of Retrograde) on bass, and
Shane Wilson (of Jack Tripper) on
drums. On the road we are usually
Siobhan, Gabe, and our buddy Scott
Streeter on drums.
Siobhan, you have played with
several different line-ups in
your rock and roll past. Tell us
a bit about your current set up
and how you folks came
together as one.
I met Gabe when my band was
touring opening for Bif Naked last
Sho
3 rhos
v,h,le
9 crazy New Wave-
aoke shows, and I met Scott at the
practice space. I seem to have
maintained a revolving-door policy
with my rhythm section, using
whoever is available, as my players
are usually busy little sluts, playing in
as many bands as possible.
Rumour has it, Fon Fon, that
you once shared a drink or
two with the late Mr. Kurt
Cobain, back when the
phenomenon of the plaid
jersey was only starting to
make its way through the
closets     of     teenage     North
America. Do fill us in. Did Kurt
drink draft or was he a
highball man? Did he call you
Fon Fon too?
The night I drank with the said Mr.
Cobain I had a free $500 tab at the
Town Pump, and I had to use it all in
one night. (Why I had that is quite
another story, far too complicated for
the scope of this interview.) We
started out on beer and moved onto
gin and tonics. Bombay Sapphir*
!. Ofc
railed n
much  €
Siobhan    when    you    have    been
drinking.
Now, your latest self-titled ep
is in fact your first release.
Have these songs been
seething inside of you, just a-
waitin' to bust out in the true
spirit of Ramones-inspired,
bleach blonde edgy retro pop-
punk? More simply put, is your
own material a huge leap
away from the work you've
done with others?
The Bombshells started out as a
bleach blonde Ramones-inspired edgy
retro pop-punk, but through the joys
of collaborative songwriting got
sucked into that mid-tempo minor-y
"these lyrics are so meaningful and I
wish I was in Alice in Chains" thingy
that everyone was doing back then
That direction led directly to the
demise of that band. Playing guitar in
Bif Naked's band was a good
experience, but the style was a bit
different from my own. The music I'm
playing now is pretty much exactly
what I set out to play ten years ago
when I started the Bombshells. It's
more like a huge leap back to my
original Rock V Roll Desires. So
yeah, those songs have been seething
Siobhan, we get the feeling
you have a special place in
your heart for kitties. There
even appears a small picture of
a kitty on your ep... and
recently you played Petfest at
UBC. What was that all about?
Baby, he died a couple of years ago.
Now I have a rat. He is a boy, and
his name is Delilah, and he doesn't
love me. Not at all. Maybe he is upset
with his name. I am also a foster
parent for the SPCA, caring for the
sick and injured animals in my home.
And here is my message: SPAY AND
NEUTER YOUR GODDAMN PETS!!!
Letting your animals have puppies
and kittens is NOT CUTE!!!
Euthanising unwanted puppies and
kittens is NOT CUTE!!! Kudos to the
Lounge Cats, who organised Petfest at
UBC in April, raising money for the
SPCA. They did a great job, and I
hope to be involved with it again next
The year is 2025. You are
scheduled to do a gig, but your
regular bandmates are bitten
by rabid monkeys and thus
cannot play. Who do you call
to replace them? And because
of this misfortune, you get to
invi»e three rock stars of choice
to be in the audience. Who do
you ask to come watch?
I replace my bandmates with
incredibly life-like robotic facsimiles (it
being 2025 and all). This is fantastic
actually, because their timing is
impeccable, and I no longer have to
deal with the fickle tendencies of slutty
musicians. (I had been replacing them
regularly anyway, and now I only
have to replace their batteries.)
I invite Deborah Harry and Joey
Ramone. Joey is in a wheelchair and
drools a lot, but Deborah is, of
course, eternally cool. I also invite
Billy Hopeless of the Black Halos and
his lovely wife Deirdre, because they
are my most loyal long-term fans.
Any future plans, and what is
your favourite kind of cheese?
I just got funding from FACTOR to
lucky that the government actually
pays us to ROCK). After that I want to
tour  as   much   as   possible.   In   the
meantime I am doing itty-bitty little
road trips around BC and working on
new songs. Havarti.
What happy things happened
to you in 1999?
1 .    My   band   got   sponsored    by
Mission Snowboards in Alberta.
2. I got my picture taken with the
Stanley Cup.
3. I broke a board with my hand in a
4. Wayne Gretzky made eye contact

JUNGLE's swansong, Long

COMIC REVIEWS BY ROBIN
GREGORY
by Marc Hempel
(Piranha)
Ah, Gregory. I can't say
enough good things about him.
Remember that when I tell you
that Gregory is a comic
about an illiterate, agoraphobic, insane four-year
old in a straitjacket and a
padded cell. Gregory first
came out in 1989, published by Piranha Press. It
is a comic which the intelligent love for its simplicity. One manages to be
enthralled by the innocence and the child-like
glory that is Gregory
The first story introduces us to Gregory as he
checks out a bunch of kids

Beginning to see a
pattern here? Yes, this
comic is dismal, sad, and
depressing (to a certain
extent). But Gregory gets
so happy. He's so hopeful
and nothing really bad
happens to him, so you
can't help but get excited.

In another story, he ventures out
into the real world for the first
time. Of course, he's terrified at
first and finds himself in the middle of an angry mob with loud
scary machines running all over
course. They take off
the straitjacket, wash
his hair and put him in
a suit, then send him off
to stay with his new
family. Gregory learns
to live with the family

of "Let's arm-wrestle,
son!" and "Why is his
head so big?" The
great thing about Fat
Boy is that "it's not so
much about Gregory as
it is about the inhabitants of his new life
(specifically his older
"brother," Rusty). The conflict
comes to a head one night in a
great climax (no, I'm not going
to ruin it for you) where you discover that Gregory's not that
odd in comparison with his new
family. In the end, he gets sent
back to his old cell, his home,
the place he loves the best.

Take, for example, the cool
kids in Jean Luc Goddard's ultra-
New Wave Band a Part
(1964; English title: Band of
Outsiders). They were doing the
right thing — learning English,
hanging out in jumping little
cafes, trying to get laid — when
they ruined it all with an ilkon-
ceived, poorly planned, badly
executed crime. Okay, so one of
the boys came from a brood of
criminals and he was just trying
to carry on the family business.
We all know (and some of us
pray fervently) that we don't
have to follow in our parents'
footsteps, even if one of them is
named Bruno. As he teaches us
all how a lesson in staying
straight is so much better when
it's shot in stunning black and
white cinematography and
includes speedy little European
cars, Goddard conducts a snappy deconstruction of classic
Hollywood crime films. Band a

you had better rent the 1960
take on Mr. Ripley — Rene
Clement's film Plein Soleil
(1960; English Title: Purple
Noon). It's a useful little primer
e on the hetero side of
the sexual spectrum). Looking as
good as its 1999 Hollywood
counterpart, but leaving the criminal minded with a more ominous warning, Plein Soliel
demonstrates quite aptly just
how a little casual murder and
larceny between friends can go
terribly wrong.

something against the French)
and all this talk of hanging out
with your pals instead of ripping
off some fast dough is falling on
deaf eyes. Maybe you've got a
little deal to hang out as a fry
cook in a little roadside diner out
on the coastal highway while
buying and selling state secrets
to the enemy. You think you're
pretty smart, alienating everyone
around you with your boorish
behaviour — especially that cute
cooked and your goose is up,
buddy, 'cause there's a hot flick
out in videoland, called Shack
Out On 707, that shows what
happens to dopes like you (or
Lee Marvin) who get too big for
their britches. It's a tough runt of
a B-movie that snaps, crackles
and pops with ridiculous dialogue and bizarre psycho-sexual tension — a must for potential
commie dupes and the people
who love them (and anyone else
who loves a great Lee Marvin
performance) If Shack Out On
101 doesn't teach you that spy
ing is bad, you'll definitely come
away with a finer understanding
of the evils of shell collecting.
Selling secrets, murdering
your friends, and planning a
heist with your language school
pals are but a few of the criminal
money-making ventures that
every good moviegoer avoids.
Of course, as any real cinephile
knows, the dough can flow
freely and easily, if only you
know which films to rent. After a
column devoted to setting you
straight, I think I'll leave that subject for another issue. •

"Why is February Black History
Month? 'Cause the Man wouldn't
give us a full 30 days/'
Seriously though, I wasn't
going to write about Black
History Month this issue (it
seemed too obvious), but then
a friend of mine brought up an
interesting question that was
posed by the Guerilla Girls:
"Q: If February is Black History
Month and March is
International Women's month,
what happens the rest of the
year? A: Discrimination." Heh.
Actually, I have mixed feelings about Black History
Month. On the one hand, it is
an important first step towards
recognising the importance of
difference and diversity; ostensibly, a celebration of that
which has been marginalised
from "traditional" (read: white)
historical perspectives.
"Recognising the contributions"
(this, in itself, is a problematic
phrase for a number of rec
of Black people and educ
young and old about ou
er, have two real problems with
the concept of Black History
Month:   first,   the   way   Black
particularly in the media, seems
less about actual people and
their experiences than about
promoting a "feel good" brand
of Black history. You know, "So-
and-so did this, and such-and-
such did that; isn't that terrific?
And they were BLACK!" The
construction of cultural icons
without
tion of either thei
viding inspiration to actively
combat the white supremacist,
capitalist, patriarchal system.
It's all well and good to go to
an event dedicated to the life of
any of the historical leaders of
the struggle, but do people then
come out and do something, or
just talk about how great that
person was and how hard they
had to struggle? Second, I question whether Black History
Month is actually about Black
people. Could it be that it is
really designed with white people in mind? I mean, Black people live Black history all of our
set aside to talk about ourselves
and what we have and what
whole  thing  has  more  to do
collective guilt by saying, in the
finest liberal tradition: "Look —

gave them a whole moi
show how much we truly care!"

It has been called to my attention that I spend a bit too much
time gushing about the merits
of quality pop music and the
sweet attributes that make it so
good (i.e. handclaps). I apologize to all of you who don't give
two hoots about a cleverly crafted pop ditty, and will attempt to
be more open to all the bits and
pieces that come my way. This
time around, I've actually stumbled across a couple of non-pop
gems! Furthermore, I actually disliked a couple of too-pop records
that I listened to. No, I am not
changing. I am set in my rut as
firmly as ever. But maybe, just
maybe, for the sake of the MFW,
I can learn to listen with an open
mind, and hands firmly planted
at my sides. Here goes.
THE  BUSY  SIGNALS is
fun, but there's not much point to
this record. The lyrics really suck,
but you can almost ignore them
if you focus instead on the laid-
back electro-pop sounds that the
band create. This 2-song release
sounds an awful lot like a
Sukpatch or Kittycraft
release — full of silly lyrics and
cool beats, all filled up with that
indie-cred style. "Too Much
Togetherness," the B-side, is
much too long for a pop song,
exciting blips and bleeps aside.
Too bad. This band shows
promise, but I'd be scared to listen to a whole album of this. It's
just a bit too cute for its own
good. (Sugar Free, PO Box

BY JULIE COLERC
PILOT/ORIGAMI split, two
good quiet bands playing cute,
jangly tunes. Test Pilot contributes
"Boy's Life," something or other
about being taken advantage of,
with speedy guitars and some
Tullycraft-esque vocals.
Origami provides a nice, sugar-
coated, girly track called "All
That Was Lost." I do not
love this but think it's
good for a spin or two.
(Kittridge, 9801 Geyser

The Sidewalk
Chalk Adventure, a
four-band compilation,
is a goodie. You gets a
GOING STAGG track
that's pleasantly upbeat
and Rose Melberg/
Softies-influenced; a
keyboard-filled, strangely dis-
tanced-vocals Busytoby song;
a sad little RADIO 4 song with
(gasp!) some handclaps; and,
most importantly, a wicked SIX
CENTS & NATALIE tune! Yes,
all them other bands keep trying
to sound like Tullycraft, but this
band really is Tullycraft (well, the
frontman's solo project)! "You
Could Be The One" is a great
song, only losing out in coolness
to the version done for the
Kindercore Christmas album,
which, slightly modified, was
called "Santa, You Could Be The
One." This song is worth tracking the 7" down for. Trust me, it's
great. (Kittridge, see above)
New Vancouver label Faint
Records has provided me with
month, garnered from GIRL
FRIDAY and THE TREMOLO
FALLS records. Girl Friday
makes very carefully-crafted
music, with sensible lyrics atop
ground. I did not take instantly
to the vocal style, done up by ex-
Knock-Down-Ginger lady
Christine, but the polished sound
may have been what put me off.
The two songs on this record are
both quite good, very radio-

do well. (Faint, c/o 1257 E.

THE HELLA-COPTERS and
ROCKET FROM THE CRYPT
have released a split of unknown

wicked tune from the 'Copters.
"Crimson Ballroom" is everything that a '70s metal band

And the best pop release of
this month? That title is happily
bestowed upon STARLET, an
endearing band from Sweden,
for the "Diary & Herself" record.
"Diary & Herself" is the sweetest
song ever, a super pop masterpiece which features a boy with
a smooth voice singing about a

What else? Neat Euro-blips
from ISAN, a band which has
managed to condense the excitement and fun of a Mouse On

This is one of those records that
sounds good at 33 or 45 RPM,

and this one is the first.
Ninetynine is a pop band from
Australia featuring the ex-drummer   from   Sleater-Kinney,
good as any of their previous
work. I like the spacey vocals
and odd vibraphone sounds.
The Ersatz song is pretty amazing. Ersatz is a local duo of
bass and accordion, and the

instrumental sounds with dark,
eerie female vocals. Excellent.

Anne Carson is a bright,

It so happens that Vancouver is a particularly
dreary place to be in the winter months. It's
cold, dark, and wet outdoors, and there's
rarely a good reason to leave our dank little
apartments and basement suites to see what
the city has to offer. This February, however, we will
get to experience a brilliant (if only ever-so-fleeting)
ray of light in the form of a three-evening Festival of
Beautiful Music, a few hours of dreamy, drifting
sounds to lighten our hearts and help us through to
the brighter days of the nowhere-near future.
Vancouver has no shortage of talented bands
and musicians who are up to the task of creating fascinating soundscapes and dreamy tunes for listeners
to bliss out to. On February 15, 16, and 17, the
Sugar Refinery will play host to a grand ensemble of
local talent, all ready to take to task the art of creating beautiful music.
What started as a series of noise shows organized by local musicians Brady Cranfield and Nic
Bragg has morphed into a chance for musicians and
djs to show their stuff in a more, well, attractively
packaged format. It is no surprise that the musicians
wanting to participate are numerous, but it is formidable that everyone involved is so fully behind the
concept of creating music for drifting.
Says Cranfield, "We want to avoid cliches. Just
because a song is long doesn't mean it's more haunting. Just because you're loud, and then quiet, and
you have a whole bunch of instruments, doesn't
mean that the song you create is more interesting or
complex. It's a challenge to be more than banal. I
expect great things."
There is an aesthetic and an academic motivation
that is a key force in putting this festival together.
Cranfield "had a change of heart," and decided that
some of his old musical influences, such as Yo La
Tengo, would be more suited as catalysts for a festival. Not that noise shows would not be successful in
this city, but who doesn't need a pick-me-up at this
time of year? As much as Cranfield worries that this
may be a "transparent, momentary infatuation" with
the idea of beautiful music, the artists he has tracked
down for the festival demonstrate that their genre is
deserving of much more than a moment of our atten-
The floating sounds and charmed ambience available to the listener this time around are in the hands
of some very capable people. The festival features
bands you may or may not have heard of yet, but all
are top-notch. If nothing else, this event presents a
chance br artists such as the Beans, Saul Duck, Sitki:,
the Secret Three, and P:ano to show us why they
should not be ignored. Whether old players at the
post-rock game (Beans) or relative newcomers
(Pano), all of the musicians involved are getting the
short end of the stick in a city which does not pay
them the attention they deserve
The Beans have one album under their belt, and
have recently completed a second. Most of the
bands playing have done extensive recording, but
few have released anything on a label. The process
of finding a label interested in a Vancouver band
seems to be rather tedious. It was the unfortunate fate
of the Secret Three to record a stellar album for a
label called Rosewood Union, out of the UK, only to
have the label fold before it could release the record.
After seeing the brave work of Montreal independent
label Constellation, the label which houses
Godspeed You Black Emperor and Fly Pan Am, both
the Beans and Sitki: tried their luck there.
Unfortunately, Constellation has dedicated itself to
releasing albums by Montreal bands.
Other labels currently supporting this type
of instrumental, improvisational, <
votive music are Fat Cat and Output, two
UK labels, who may be more receptive to
the happenings in our fair city.
Circlesquare is one local band which
has had some overseas luck. DJ Stereo 8,
as he is to be billed for his Beautiful Music
performance, is the man behind the
Circlesquare sound. Responsible for two
self-released eps, Circlesquare creates
"down" music full of samples, guitars, and
occasional vocals. Circlesquare's sound
has recently become somewhat harder,
incorporating some of the traits of dark
drum and bass electronica, but the music
continues to serve the purpose of "pull[i
[the listeners] back into the human world."
Seems like the tug was felt by Output, and
the band has recently released an ep on
that label. The 1 2" version comes complete
with a film made by Stereo 8, featuring a
self-composed and orchestrated soundtrack. The film, starring Beans guitarist Tygh
Runyen, is a dream-inspired story of two
lovers who lose touch with reality. Stereo
8 is very optimistic about this release and
upcoming works on the label.
Stereo 8 is excited to be involved in the
Beautiful Music festival, as he narrowly
missed a chance to see Labradford's London version
not long ago. He did, however, catch a performance
by La Monte Young, part of a series entitled
"American Pioneers," which also featured Phillip
Glass. "His whole thing is drones," enthuses Stereo
8. Two and a half hours of drones, to be precise, at
this particular show, during which six muted trumpets
and six cellos presented the audience with ever-so-
slight variations on six notes. Young is credited with
being an inspiration for post-rock favourites Tortoise,
and his influence will be felt at the Beautiful Music festival. If it's not the jangle of guitars that gets you feeling warm inside, then it must be the drone of a
solitary note, or maybe two, that helps to take you to
a better place.
An important concern of Cranfield's is to "up the
profile" of the bands involved. I had the pleasure of
meeting and talking to some of the musicians
involved in the event. The longer I spoke with Patrick
O'Deady, drummer and button-knob twiddler for sibly
Sitki:, the more enthusiastic about the concept he
became. It seems he, like many of the others
involved, was not fully informed of the motives
behind the festival, but was more than willing to give
the idea a try.
Sitki: is a two-piece (formerly three, but the keyboardist went his own way) boy/girl experimental
band which excels in the art of sound manipulation,
show, guitarist Sherry Ostapovitch craft-
i set by wiring sources through a collec-
pect great things from the Beans, and from
the jazz musicians involved," says Cranfield, who
feels confident that the sounds on these nights will
be innovative and intriguing. There will be some
musicians normally involved in the bands Broken
Record Chamber on one evening, although it is yet
undecided in what formation they will be performing There's plenty of room for experimentation here.
Damon Henry of Saul Duck, a three-piece responsible for taut, mathy, Slint-like music, also expressed
his interest in the opportunity to "stretch things out"
for the performance. Saul Duck will be trying its hand
at the art of repetition, working \
pieces and playing around. The band has been
active for about two years, and has completed a
couple of recordings, one as a two-piece (guitar and
drums), and one as a three-piece. The more recent
three-piece is the one that made it onto my desk while
tion of pedals, improvising to create an interesting
array of sounds.
"We use our ideas [from rehearsal] as starting
points, so we don't draw a blank when we're playing live, but it's a lot of improvising. It's not a 'rock
jam,' we're just trying to create something different."
The band plays with structure and improvisation to
create diverse musical arrangements, no two sets
ever sounding the same. A nice change from verse-
chorus-verse, that's for certain. This will be one of the
highlights of the Beautiful Music festival: change.
In recent years, the Sugar Refinery has been a
stand-out location for local talent that pushes genre
boundaries. The Beans, Saul Duck, and the Secret
Three are all regulars on the Refinery's roster, filling
the small room with impressive ambient sounds to
accompany the consumption of the city's best pero-
gies (that's a shameless plug). This time^around, all
three bands will be playing some new material, pos-
writing this article, and I have to admit, the music is
impressive. The four-song ep, recorded at the tail-end
of 1998, with two epic tracks and some interesting
arrangements, leads me to believe that the Saul Duck
live experience will be well-suited to the night of drifting, if toned down a touch. The rule, according to
Brady, is to not "rock out" — nothing snaps you out
of a pleasant drift quicker than a crunchy guitar!
The Beans are going to be on their best behaviour. The prohibition against rocking out should not
be slowing these guys down, though, so don't worry.
"We've gotten a lot more mellow. We've been getting tired of freaking out all the time. That's what we
used to do all the time. Now that we have a new
bassist in the band, it's added a lot of warmth, and
it's mellowed us out. I think it's natural that we'll ease
right into the ambient thing," says Stefan Udell, guitarist for the Beans. "Who knows what's going to
happen?"
So there you have it. Three nights of mystery,
cloaked in dreamy soundscapes and ambient creations, three nights of pleasant escape from the win-
tery dreariness of the city that surrounds us. Some
innovation, lots of inspiration, and a good time to
be had by all. Don't let this opportunity to mix and
mingle with the up-and-comers of the Vancouver
scene pass you by; this beautiful music is not to be

Luke Meat
James   McNew   is   the
bassist for Yo La Tengo and
the frontman for his  own
band Dump.   Dump writes
sweetly subtle pop gems, suitable for lonely nights or cruising with your walkman on " 10".
Dump played The Brickyard on
October   24th.   DiSCORDER's
Luke Meat had an opportunity to
speak with this incredibly diverse
DiSCORDER: Test. Test. 'This is
Homer Simpson saying hello
to all the ladies out there in
rodioland.'
James McNew: That's my favorite
episode!
So, keeping with The
Simpsons... [Meat attempts
his best Kent Brockman
impersonation] Who are you,
and what are you doing
here?
My name is James McNew and I
just finished playing a rock 'n roll
extravaganza here in Vancouver
as a  member of the group
Dump, as well as a side man
for the group Refrigerator.
Was   your   very  first
recording on a ghetto-
blaster?
My very first recording
was on two desktop
tape recorders placed
playing the track that I had just
recorded, and the other one recording myself singing, and the other
thing being played on the tape
recorder at the same time. I think I
s 1 1
r 12.
Does the D.I.Y. ethic still exist?
Well, I think so. I think it exists everywhere. I guess it's an 'ethic' I think a
lot of people who are doing it — or
doing it well — don't believe it's an
ethic. They believe that you just get
up in the morning and... I remember
going on tours with Yo La Tengo and
we had a soundman named Terry
Pearson who had been a soundman
for lots and lots of years —well, he's
Beck's soundman now so we'll never
be able to afford him again — but
he's a fantastic, amazing guy at
what he does. I remember going to
shows with him — like Bozeman,
Montana was one that I can remember where we showed up and they
had a P.A. [that] didn't work, so Terry
spends two hours with some duct
tape, some paper clips, and a styro-
foam cup and fixes the P.A.
The MacGyver of soundmen?
Kinda MacGyverish, but he was just
amazing. He would show up and do
it and indirectly keep the rock 'n roll
alive for everybody! Like The Blair
Witch Project, for example.
What about it?
I thought it was really good!
I haven't seen it, I'm afraid.
It is on sale just in time for
Hallowe'en!
I would recommend watching it at
home as opposed to the theatre. But
I thought it was awesome: it didn't
cost anything to make; it^didn't have
anybody in it.
And it made a whackload of
cash!
Except for that fact...
Ira   Robbins,   editor   of   The
Trouser Press Record Guide,
called Dump 'sweet as kittens'
and  said  the charm  within
Dump is 'all [your] fault.'
How do you feel about
that?
Ha ha. I have no
problem with
tens. They're fine. I don't bother them
and they don't bother me.
With the release of The
Sebadoh and Guided by
Voices' Do the Collapse, which
break from both bands' notorious under-produced sound,
does 'lo-fi' have a future?
I thought Do the Collapse was really
good, but I haven't heard the new
Sebadoh.
But Pollard and Barlow aren't
recording songs in their basements anymore.
Oh, no no. They've graduated! But I
mean, you wonder how much people do it out of necessity or record
that way just for rhe sake of immediacy. You have something you want
to play right now and you can't wait
for nine months of rehearsal, pre-production, and a studio. You just gotta
spit it out tonight and have it ready
Did the Silver Apples ever
think that way?
Oh, hell — who knows what they
believed in!
How did you ever hear about
them?
I heard about them from a member
of the band The Happy Flowers.
Do The Happy Flowers still
exist?
Well, they're still alive, but they don't
play anymore. I talk to them all the
time through the miracle of e-mail.
What is 'ziti'?
It's a medium-length tubular pasta...
it's a pasta dish.
Are   you   aware   that   your
grandfather's ziti recipe is on
the Matador website?
Yes.
Did you know that Miles Davis
used to make chili and phone
Mingus and Coleman and tons
of hipsters and simply say
'chili' to invite them over, then
just hang up?
After reading his autobiography, I
don't think I'd eat anything he
touched!
But would you phone all the
scenesters in indieland and
just say 'ziti' and hang up?
I cook all the time, in my back yard.
I have a big BBQ grill. A month
ago I made a slow-smoked pork
shoulder. It took about eight hours.
Got up at 6am, started cookin'...
[Meat presents McNew with a
copy of issue 7 of the comic
Eight ball, which features a letter from McNew in the 'letters'
section.]   Would   you   mind
signing this?
[Taken aback] Oh! Wow!
Are you still a fan?
I think Dan Clowes is one of the most
talented writers that I can think of.
He's an amazing artist, too, but his
writing just blows me away.
Have you  heard  that they
might be turning Ghost World
[an   Eightball series]  into  a
If Dan Clowes is involved in the writing and the actual making of the
movie then I would definitely be interested in seeina it.
Oh, Okay. Um... sorry, but it's
Yo La Tengo time.
Okay.
What's Jad Fair like?
He's a lovely guy. I had him sleep at
my house many times. Very polite.
Very clean. Big eater. Sports fan.
He once said he wants to
write the most popular song
of all time. Will he?
If anybody's gonna do it, it's gonna
be him.
Yo La Tengo pretty much had
a revolving-door policy for
years when it came to
bassists. Why have you lasted?
I don't know. I think they're just trying
to figure out a way to... y'know. I just
kept showing up for practice and I
felt like a part.
Okay. Can we talk about the
Simpsons credits [Yo La Tengo
did the closing credits for the
'hippie'   episode   last   year
which featured George Carlin
& Martin Mull]?
What happened was we demo'd
three versions of the end credits
that I recorded in our practice
space. One was like a
'Tomorrow   Never
Knows,'
gnarly garage punk thing where
the   melody   was   played   on   a
farfisa organ. The other was a tribute to the song  'Ohm'  by John
Coltrane, but that was a little too
abstract. Anyway, we had something to do in Los Angeles and we
decided to make a big weekend out
of it. We went into a recording studio with a few Simpsons producers.
We had to get exactly 1:02 minutes.
Then Dan Castellaneta came in and
just sort of improvised about ten
takes. He just kept talking. He was
hilarious. Sadly, I don't have any
copies of his many hippie rants,
but they were really amazing.
That morning I got to see them
record an episode ['Lisa Joins
Mensa']. We were done working around 8:30, but I went
straight to bed after because I
thought, 'Well, it's been the
best day of my life so I'm
calling it quits.' [laughter]
I loved your cover of
'The Beautiful
Ones' by Prince.
Do you have a
dirty mind?
Ha     ha     ha...

Roy:  We got some insulting
offer from Matador, too, when
we got off Reprise.
Kim: But, then, they just got off
Capitol and they didn't have any
money and that's why.
Ronnie: So, if Liz Phair had a
hit record last year, we'd be on

Nardwuar the Human

the Human Serviette

August/September 1997
issue of Vice, Vol. 4 #7,
Nardwuar interviewed
contemporary film legend
Ron Jeremy and presented
him with a box of
'hedgehog' chocolates. In
honour of Nardwuar's
recent recovery and, as a
tribute to his benevolence,
I'd like to present you
with...
And we snagged it. It s ours now!
Ronnie: And then he died.
Kim: He started beating up on
Ronnie, so Ronnie and I started
beating up on him together.
We're a good team for fighting

Anyway, I was in Seattle
and I came across a new
Muffs seven-inch that said
'From the forthcoming

Okay.   In   a   DiSCORDER

at the DiSCORDER anniversary
party in, like, '91.
kissers. But the people at Honest
Don's seem really nice. Erin and
Fat Mike are really super-nice
and I can tell it's genuine.
Roy: They're just into all the
bands that they sign.
Kim: These guys are more than
fair. We've talked with other
independent labels who are just
a bunch of tightwads, but Mike
and Erin are just very generous.

Kim:      You'n

octaves] ...with three sour

All: Thanksl
So,  I  was  in   Seattle the
other    day    and,    while
checking out the illustrious
Singles     Going     Steady
record store...
Kim: There's one called that?
Do you think they like the fuckin'
Buzzcocks or what?
The Buzzcocks played here
last weekend and it was,
like, 25 bucks to get in or
some shit like that.
Ronnie: TWENTY-FIVE
BUCKS?!
Kim: Pete Shelley has to pay for
his toupee.
Roach Ghoulie He's bald?
Kim: We played with the
Buzzcocks in '93 and he was
wearing a wig and during the
show it slipped down, so he had
a really low hairline for a second
[laughs].
Ronnie: And then their bass
player stole a coat from the coat-
check.
Serious!?!
Ronnie:   [in   a   mock   British
accent] He fancied it.
Roy: I fancy this coat.
Ronnie: He's a RAT.
Kim: The only thing that Ronnie
ever stole from any club that I
know of was one time when he
was getting kicked out of a club
and we got in this big fist-fight with
this horrible, stupid bouncer, and,
finally, after the melee was over, I
say,     'Ronnie,     look    at    that
autographed Johnny  Thunders
picture over there!' and he was
like, 'Yeah, we should take it!'
the Record Industry.'
I   came   back   home   and
said to Nardwuar, 'You're
interviewing   the   Muffs.
What the fuck is up with
this? They just signed to
Honest Don's.' He wasn't
too sure, though.
Kim:   We're   putting   out   an
album called Hamburger. We're
putting    it   out   on    Sympathy
because it's a retrospective.
Ronnie: It's got all our early
singles. We took everything and
didn't ask anyone.
Roy:    We've    got   a    phone
message from Courtney Love.
We're    gonna    get   sued    by
everyone.
Kim:    I'm   even   gonna   sue
us   because   I   put  on   demos
Ronnie: We've even got C.C.
Deville on there.
Just like the new Len song!
Kim: So Len basically copied
the Muffs!
Ronnie: But, anyway, right now
the CD is touronly.
Roy: But it'll be out next year in
the stores. It was gonna be out
earlier, but then our label found
out about it.
We were about four months old.
But in this issue — this was
right after you'd  signed
with Reprise — you were
asked...
Kim: 'How could you do such a
HORRIBLE fuckin'thing?!'
Exactly.
Kim: Oh, sorry, we just do this
for a fucking hobby.
Ronnie     said,     jokingly,
'Fuck independent labels.'
How different is it for you
guys, now, being back on
an indie?
Kim: It's just less money, slightly
less   red   tape   and,   actually,
they're more organized.
Are    they    doing     good
promo for you, though?
Because    I    heard    that
promotion was one of the
main  problems you  had
with Reprise.
Kim: Honestly, it's not that much
different.       I       mean       the
people are nice at both labels.
We had some fuckers at Reprise,
but        they        were only
passive-aggressive fuckers who
:ause we were hit up by Triple
ecords who wanted to sign us
a six-record deal for a
iusand dollars. They're just a
ich of assholes.
.iletn.
Are you pissed off, or
jaded, or anything 'cause
you seem to have this
crazy crossover appeal,
you know? Kids who are
into hardcore, kids who
are into punk, kids who
are into indie pop —
people who despise every
pop-punk band out there
— they all seem to love
you guys. I mean, my
friend Farkas and I were
talking and we were like,
'The Muffs write better
songs than the Beatles.'
You take a song like
'Agony' or 'I'm a Dick'...
those are songs that have
the potential to be big hit
singles. Summer anthems.
Don't you feel like you
haven't got the success
you deserve?
Ronnie: Well, I think that's why
we're still around eight and a
half years after we started.
We've held steady. We've seen
a lot of bands come and go
Kim: A lot of people still hate it
when we play poppy songs
'cause we appeal to the punks
and the poppy geeks, so at our
shows you see old bald-headed
popsters and little mohawk-y
people side by side. The punks
always want to hear the fast
ones and the old guys are like
'aaahhhhh.'
I'll bet there's gonna be a
lot of people here tonight
who, if you were any
other band, would call you
a bunch of sell-outs
for going on a major or for
allowing   a   song   on   a
Snapple commercial.
Kim: Fruitopia.
But with you guys it's
different. They're like,
'Yeah, but it's the Muffs!'
Ronnie: [Sarcastically] We
turned down Reebok.
Kim: It is a business though.
It is show business. I feel that you
should be able to make a living
at whatever you do well.
Unfortunately, the only way to
have somebody dorky and
corporate put it out. Whatever
floats your boat. I mean I don't
even drink the shit.
Roy: You know, when you think
about it, it's really not that different
from working anywhere.
Ronnie: What, is the music not
;al 'c
jhng
off a floor?
Have you guys managed
to get rid of the 'girl-band
geeks'?
Kim: I think so. They just want
to see big ol' fake tits and a
purple guitar. When Melanie left
the band we kind of lost some of
the GBGs.
Now  I  tried  to think  of
some really        smart
question to end off with
but I couldn't...
Ronnie:    Doot   Doola    Doot
Doot...
Kim: 'Okay, bye.'
That's  usually what happens.
It takes most people a little while
to figure out what Nardwuar is
talking about. Jane Wiedlin got
it, though.
It took her a couple of times, but
it takes everyone a couple of
times at first if you don't know
Nardwuar. I knew right away.
But most rock stars are dumb as
Alright, then; Doot Doola
Doot Doot...
Kim: Okay, bye. •

groovy are you guys?
Amy: Fucking groovy!
Roach:   I've   got  flowers  on
my T-shirt. That's groovy.
Kepi: I have these bracelets that
teenage girls wear and they
sparkle; I'm groovy.
Roach:    We    try    to    be    a
combination   of   groovy   and
ghoulie,   so one   just doesn't
B-Face: There's nothing groovy
You have a pretty hectic
touring schedule. Do you
lead normal lives or have
day jobs?
Roach:     No,    we    try    not
to be normal.
Amy: I don't know what I do
between tours, 'cause this is my
first tour with the band. Soon I'll
find out what I'll do between
tours. Hopefully I won't get a
day job. I hate that.
Roach: Hopefully you'll just sit
around your parent's house...
Kepi: ...waiting to live in the
van again. Amy just found out
the van is her new home.
So   how   long   have   you
guys been groovin'?
Amy:     I've    been    groovin'
for  about  ten   days.   But  the
band's been together for, like,
ten years.
Kepi: Yeah, there were other
Groovie   Ghoulies,    but   this
is the one.
Amy:      It's      always      been
Kepi though.
You have rotating
drummers, it seems.
Kepi: Hopefully not anymore.
What's with the rotating
drummers?
Roach: They're all quitters.
So   where   did   you   pick
up Amy?
Kepi: At a bar.
Roach: In Juvey.
Amy: Yeah, I was in Juvenile for
the past two years.
Kepi: She's actually been our
drummer for two years, but she
was in jail, so we just got her
out. [Mimicking Canadian
accent] Ooot.
Amy:   Yeah,   they   just   got
Is that what Canadians are
supposed to talk like?
Kepi: Yeah, we're slurring you.
South Park teaches us to  be
racist pigs.
B-Face:     Chixdiggit    taught
us that.
Roach: They talk like that all the
time and we love them.
Amy:  So do the Smugglers.
It's not true!
Kepi: I know. We just believe
what we read  in the media
Anyway, we met Amy through
the Donnas. We're friends with
them,   and  she's friends with
them, and we're all friends.
Roach: We're all family.
What other bands we're
you  guys  in  before  the
Ghoulies?
Roach:     Me,      none;      just
the Ghoulies.
Amy:  I was in a Kiss cover
band with two of the Donnas for
Kepi: What was it called?
Amy: We didn't have a name.
We just played four Kiss songs
Roach: Kepi was in a bunch
of bands.
Kepi:    No,    only   the    Berry
Pickers.  I've been a Ghoulie
Do   you    prefer    playing
all-ages      shows      over
bar shows?
Kepi: After last night.
Roach: Yeah.
What happened last night?
Kepi: There were four fights,
it was rumble-rific.
Roach: Kids are fun. I like it
when kids get to come out.
What     do     you     think
are   the   pros   and   cons
of both?
Kepi: Well the con of a bar
shos
s kids
B-Face: Pros of the all-ages
[shows] is that kids generally
have more energy. They're not
Kepi: Kids rock. Older people
might stay away 'cause they
can't have a beer, but we
encourage old people to drink in
their cars before the show. It's
cheaper and more fun. There's
no one to put a limit on you. So
drink on up and come in. I
guess. Drink like crazy -
responsibly please.
Kepi and Roach, you two
are married. Does that put
any     strain     on     being
in a band?
Roach:   No
Kepi: It's all good. We've been
in the band the longest so it must
be working out — unless we
drive   all   the   other   members
away. B-Face is hard of hearing
so he doesn't hear all the fights.
B-Face: Huh?
I  hear  that the  Groovie
Ghoulies really like cats.
What   kind   of   cats   do
you have?
Kepi: Yay cats!
Roach: We only have one. Kepi
and I have one named Kapu, but
he lives with Grandma.
Kepi:   B-Face   has   two  cats.
One's  named Jitters  and  the
other is Elsa.
B-Face can't answer for
himself?
Kepi: No, I'm his boss. Amy
had a cat named Casper.
Amy: My cat died.
Kepi: The truth is, I made up the
name Jitters. He [B-Face] doesn't
really       have       that       cat.
[To   B-Face]   You   can   answer
for yourself.
B-Face: Yeah, I only have one
cat named Elsa.
Roach: Pee-er.
B-Face:   Huh?  Oh  yeah,   my
cat's a pee-er. Pees. One time I
had a friend over who put his
jacket down and she... right on
the inside of his leather jacket.
That shit stinks.
Is        Hallowe'en        your
favourite holiday?
Roach:   Yeah,   but  this  year
we didn't play a show.
Kepi: We were waiting for Amy
Amy: I was on tour with the
Donnas in Europe. It was really
boring and it sucked. We were
just driving around. It
[Hallowe'en] is a new thing in
Europe so they don't really
celebrate it. They're trying to get
people into it.
Kepi: You guys should have
dressed up like each other.
Amy: Actually, Donna F dressed
treating to Donna A's hotel room.
That was as far as it went.
Lastly, what's your advice
for the kids?
Amy: Rock 'n roll.
Roach: Yeah — do it.
Kepi: Rock.

JEREMY BOYLE
Songs from the Guitar Solos
(Southern)
First off, I don't know what this
CD is supposed to be all about,
but it was definitely nothing like
what I expected it to be If there
is some sort of concept that this
album is built on (and I am guessing there might be since all of the
tracks are named after 'classic'
rock bands, such as "Van
Halen," "Sabbath," and
"Zeppelin"), then I am mystified.
Jeremy Boyle, a member of
the post-rock band Joan of Arc,
has put together 40-odd minutes
worth of melody-less and beat-
free soundscapes. Since I am not
exactly a connoisseur of this style
of music, I didn't know how to listen to it or what to make of it.
First I tried listening to it through
headphones while walking to
class; it didn't do much for me.
Each track sounded like a whole
lot of nothing. It wasn't unbearable to listen to, just kind of boring. I tried playing it in my car
while I drove; it had the same
effect... yawn. Finally, I let it play
while I sat at home and did my
homework. This was what made
me really dig the record, and let
me understand what entertainment value such 'plain' sound-
scape music could have. The
sounds that Boyle presents to the
listener are projected perfectly
through the sharp stereo sound
inside your living room or bedroom. Subtly different tones, volumes, and pitches are pushed
gently out of opposite speakers
and are then neatly rearranged
in the tightly-packed confines of
your ear. Songs From The Guitar
Solos is the perfect accompaniment to a quiet study session,
and sounds a lot better than
those buzzing fluorescent lights
on the ceiling above your reading space. Contrary to the title, it
is definitely not something you
can sit down and rock out to, fingers in a horned salute.

CLASS
A Quiet Life
(Double Agent)
Aside from the fact that I am
freaking  out because  I   have
been informed that my novel
might be getting published, I am
pretty much ready and prepared
to focus on this review. Okay,
here goes.
Class are part of that wave
of sound that generally falls into
the category of Ethereal Pop.
You know, that minimalistic
genre of synthesizers and otherworldly vocals. This is not a bad
thing. Oh, no. This is definitely
not a bad thing. I find that this
type of music helps when one
needs to write overly poetic novels (that might be published).
Despite five of the six songs
being mixes and re-mixes of
"Strobe Light," the A Quiet Life
EP shows that Class is capable
of remarkable diversity within its
minimalism. The quietness and
simplicity of their music makes
each sound seem overly important; a sort of musical William
Carlos Williams effect.
In fact, all these words seem
to be overly complex and convoluted in comparison. I look forward to the world Class creates
— simple, beautiful, poetic.

DAHLIA SEED
Excuse All the Blood
(Spirit of Orr)
You know those annoying people who constantly tell "back in
the day" stories? Well, I'm one
of them. This is, I think, what
makes me like this CD so darn
much. I bought my first Dahlia
Seed 7" about five or six years
ago. I loved it despite the fact
that the songs were so catchy
that my roommates would wander around singing them to the
point of driving me insane. So,
when I listened to this CD I was
taken aback, 'cause most of the
songs were recorded back in the
day. Tracy's vocals are strong;
they remind me of the first time I
drove the 12 hours to New
Jersey from Toronto to hear them
live. Dahlia Seed are catchy and
awesome and they have a song
called "Missing Sequences"
(Voivod rules) — any American
band that gives props to
Canadian metal is ace. I know
what yer thinking: "Grandma
tells us about the music." Well,
kiddo, it's hardcore. Hardcore
like it was back in the day.

FLIGHT 180
(BEC)
Take an eight-piece Christian
ska-punk band from SoCal and
have them play an album full of
swingier tunes, and you get an
album which is much better than
I thought it would be. The first
half of the album is dance-y and
upbeat, with covers of Brian
Setzer   and   Louis   Prima,
among others. But the second
half is a boring crooning affair
with the capper being two hon-
est-to-goodness spiritual swing
songs, the last being the infamous Arlen and Koehler
show tune "Get Happy." Excuse
my unhipness, but I thought
swing was dead. Well, if
schlocky Christian music still
manages to survive many horrible bands, then this swing thing

These garage girls know how to
rock. The Sisters have put togeth-
of their singles. Backed by Billy
Childish's Headcoats, the
Headcoatees have their hands
free to sing and shout. When
you first listen to this record, you
will no doubt feel the urge to
clap yer hands and get up and
dance. As you listen to it more
and start to know the words, it
will become impossible to resist
singing along. This album contains classic Headcoatees hits
such as "Davey Crocket," "Ca
Plaine Pour Moi," "Headcoat
Girl," "My Boyfriend's Learning
Karate," and many, many more.
TOP $ PAID FOR PUNK VINYL
My personal fave is their crazy
cover      of      The       Sonics
"Strychnine." If you dig the
garage scene but are still not
Headcoatee-literate, or just don't
own very many of their 7" platters, head down to your record
store and pick up a copy. You
won't be disappointed, because
this release has 16 hits and not
a single miss.

Jazz meets traffic in a congested

"LUH" begins with Steve

are held together by sheer musicianship alone. Slowly, but with

deconstructs, and the end is

JAMES KOCHALKA
SUPERSTAR
Carrot Boy The Beautiful: A
Rock Opera
(Sudden Shame)
I drive everyone up the wall with
this music James Kochalka,
comic book artist extraordinaire,
has released another whimsical
foray into pop music, this time in
the form of a rock opera with
karaoke tracks tacked on the
end. The story goes a little something like this: an outcast scientist
decides that, to get back at all
the stupid people who dor
will  c
of
mutant carrot men to destroy the
world. Unfortunately, things do
not go as planned for the scientist. The fruit (or vegetable, as it
were) of his labours is a very
cute, extremely friendly little guy
named Carrot Boy. This little
sweetie is not at all interested in
destroying the world, as he'd
much rather play with a kitty
who wanders into the garden.
There is a scuffle as the scientist
tries to hurt Kitty (he's pretty mad
about being dissed by Carrot
Boy), but love triumphs, and Kitty
and Carrot Boy live happily ever
after. There you have it — a very
convincing and moving rock
opera, filled with many diverse
and well-voiced characters.
Wow. You even get a mini-comic
to go with the story! This man is
a genius. Carrot Boy... is much
less offensive than Kochalka's
W ft^ l&M- previous CD efforts [The True
Story of... featured a song
called "Magic Finger (It's My
Dink!)" that was pretty kickin'),
but just as full of quality tunes.
You need all of JKS's music, for
the sake of your sanity, and the
insanity of those you love to bug.

Xtra-Acme USA
(Matador)
It is rare that an album which is
essentially an afterthought (read:
contractual obligation album) is
better than the album from which
it derives its material. Xtra-Acme
USA is a remix and outtakes
albun
ismg  i.
trial fro
intended for last year's Acme
album. Featuring such studio
whizzes as Moby, Steve
Albini, Calvin Johnson,
Money Mark and Jack
Dangers at the controls, this
album is easily one of the most
adventurous releases bearing
the Matador logo. All those
remixes overshadow an outtake
tune called "Lap Dance," featuring the guitar and vocal work of
blues legend Andre Williams.
Amalgamations of Jon Spencer's
blues-inspired mayhem and
world beat, dance and rap
make this a must-have for a fan
of JSBX or any of the above-mentioned contributors.

fierce album, not only because
of Krust's set in Osaka that night,
but also from the intense remixes
he has recently released.
Surprisingly, that's not exactly
the case. While he's not reverting completely to washed-out,
dreamy beats, there's a great
range of intensity within this
album. The album eases in with
nothing particularly grounding,  but once Morgan's

style, there is a dark undercurrent running throughout.

Williams' dense lyrics build the
tension of the track to unbelievable heights. His words are not
easily unraveled on first listen,
but they're definitely worth paying attention to. Krust compliments the lyrical force with his
growling bass lines and simple,
recurring melodies. At the end of
the track, there is pretty much
nowhere to go but down, and so
the song fades into "One
Moment," a solemn piece performed by a string section with
no drums at all.
The rest of the album is
solid, but it's difficult to notice in
light of the charged title track.
On other songs, however,
Morgan's vocals focus emotion
effectively. Coded Language
proves that Roni Size is not the

Let's Get Busy
(Ipecac)
It's a big ol' retarded world we
live in; the endless pursuit of
happiness has most of us running like hamsters in a miniature
Ferris wheel. Shit gets us down
and most of us pout, cry, grow
mullets, get drunk on Bianca
wine, or pick fights (except for
the yippies; they usually listen to
some Jackson Browne and
consult the teachings of their
holy homeboy the Dalai Lama to
find the path toward eternal
bliss). Well, these nine differently-able crackers from Widney
what being happy is all about.
Their happiness is as ubiquitous
as sunshine in LA and their
enthusiasm is fuckin' contagious.
The Kids' nutty lyrics cut the
Jackson Browne background up
like Yan cuts vegetables for his
wok. They remind me of my boy
Juice, a Downs kid who loves
eatin'chips, listenin'to AC/DC,
watchin' rasslin', and bein' a
joker. Juice had some health
problems recently, and when I
went to see him at the hospital, I
realised that, even when his
body's in a worse state of disrepair than a 1976 Gremlin, he
can still manage to light up an

LAKUNA
Castle of Crime
(4AD)
After listening to this album, I
recommended it to my friend,
but was at a loss for words to
describe it. Church bells, pitch-
shifted vocals, and dirty guitar
samples are littered throughout.
The live drums of David Narcizo
work nicely alongside sampled
drum loops, and Frank
Gardner's bass lines propel the
rhythm forward effortlessly. The
mood of the album is somewhat
sinister on tracks like "The Veil,"
but others, like "St. Paul's
Piano," with its sparse keyboard
melodies and minimal rhythm
lime calm Lakuna's choice of
ethnic sound samples coupled
with slow, melancholic beats
gives a somber, world-beat
flavour to this release. It's not,
however, so slow that you'll
drown in introspection and forget the funk. Listening to Castle

and return only when the disc

LOUD
taikoelectric
(Independent)
For those of you who have
missed Loud's tight, compelling
gigs around town the past couple of years, now is your chance
for redemption. No, this isn't
some straight-edge hardcore
band; Loud is a threesome composed of Eileen Kage and Leslie
Komori on taiko percussion
(they also play with Sawagi
Taiko, Vancouver's all-female
taiko group), and Elaine Stef on
electric guitar (who has been
seen playing with Toronto's
Lillian Allen and Montreal's
Rhythm Activism). An unlikely combo, but one that works
and works hard.
Most tracks are instrumental, with the occasional whoop
thrown in as punctuation. The
almost wistful, but the complex
percussion lends an urgency
that drives each track to a precise ending. Fri

NEBULA
To the Center
(Sub Pop)
On Nebula's first full-length CD,
it seems the guys had one too
many bong tokes while writing
the songs to come up with any
original ideas. To the Center
starts off all right with the title
track, and continues along with
a couple of fuzzy mid-tempo
rockers, but most of the CD just
falls flat. While the group tries
the s
ind of i
rock groups in their heyday
(Blue Cheer, Iggy and the
Stooges) and even steals licks
from long-gone Seattle grunge
groups, they forget to create
memorable songs. As far as the
stoner rock genre goes, the best
bands — Fu Manchu, Kyuss,
Queens of the Stone Age
- all offer up better tunes that
will make any pot party a smoking success.

No Memory

Voila, the return of Neil Gust,

chaos of "The Last Potato Polka"
(with accordion!), it's a treat to
hear traditional Japanese percussion updated with such
unique style. Despite the potential excess of the instruments and
the title of the band, there's a
spareness to the sound, reminiscent of early Calexico .. if John
Convertino was a dynamic
woman taiko drummer, that is.
I still prefer Loud live; but,
though taikoelectric is more polished and less intense than the
real thing, this debut CD is the
best local effort I've heard in a
long time.

Heatmiser records, the one who
sang when Smith took a back
seat. No Memory sounds very
much like a few of the more
recent Elliott Smith records, with
a great pop sensibility and very
catchy hooks. There are some
hot guest appearances here
which refuse to let Gust move
on entirely: Sam Coomes (now
of Quasi, ex- of Heatmiser)
and Elliott Smith both play small
parts in the making of this
music. Please do not, however,
dismiss this record as an imitation of better things. No. 2's

have a great sound. If you're

As these Frenchies showed us

rock 'n' roll can break any language barrier. Despite the fact
that I couldn't tell what they
were saying due to a punk
rock-induced hearing problem,
the singer's stage moves told
me all I needed to know. The

PLANET SMASHERS
KINGPINS
UNDERCOVERS
Friday, November 19
Starfish Room
The Stomp Records showcase,
featuring Montreal's ska sensations the Planet Smashers,
bulldozed the masses of rude
boys and girls at the Starfish
Room on November 19th. I had
originally planned to go to the
Nick Drake tribute at the
Vancouver East Cultural Centre,
but tickets for the Planet Smashers
gig presented themselves at the
last minute. And how fortuitous it
was to be present at the Starfish
Room that night! Dancing, merriment and noise-making climaxed
in an earth-shattering encore by
the 'Smashers, which saw half
the audience climb up onto the
stage to dance and sing along
with the band. There is just something about the ska community in
this city that makes these types of
shows something special. Certain
gigs you remember for a long
time afterwards for one reason or
another. Everything seemed to go
perfectly on this night, and the
Montreal quintet proved themselves, once and for all, to be
perhaps one of the greatest and
tightest performing ska bands this
country has ever produced
(alongside late greats King
Apparatus and Pressure
Cooker)
I arrived a little too fashionably late and missed the
Undercovers' set, but that's
life. The Kingpins (also from
Montreal) were solid and managed to fill the dancefloor up
with their entertaining but slightly flat versions of two-tone tunes.
I was, however, particularly
impressed at how they managed
to up the energy level when they
played their "hit," "The Ten
Commandments of Ska," about
three-quarters through their set.
In all, the Stomp Records
night of music, and the Starfish
seemed to be the perfect locale
on this night. As great as the
Commodore is, I doubt this intimate sense of community would
have translated nearly as well to
the spring-loaded floor.

MODERN BAROQUE
OPERA COMPANY
The Garden of Love:
Venus and Adonis by
Alessandro Scarlatti;
The Amazement by
Dominico Scarlatti
Saturday, December 4
Vancouver East Cultural
Centre
Modern   Baroque   Opera   ha<
1996, updating spin:
supply of castrati was to cast top
tenor David Lee as Venus and
Soprano Jennie Such as Adonis.
With both singers performing in
similar ranges, this solution did
Lee would be exceeding his
range in either role. The gender-
switch casting decision may
have had a sociological or political significance, but the outcome was silly. Lee came off as
a moping wet noodle in a toga.
He was outdone by the genuinely excellent singing and acting of
Such, though no direct comparison could fairly be applied; the
BRICKYARD
some" type of intro [though it
is]).
The first band, The
Microphones, managed to
partly calm down the otherwise
excited crowd with their uterine
ballads. The sedated-yet-angelic
voice of the singer mixed
strangely with the out-of-tune guitar and out-of-rhythm dru
mliv
of
lethargy that made me want to
crawl into some corner and suck
my thumb as I rocked back and
forth, possessed by dementia.
Good looking band, though.
And then the gentle sonic
storm that is Stereolab snapped
me out of my dialogue with my
child.
Stereolab was delivering. Rapid-
rain beats, reminiscent of Pink
Floyd and a certain infamous
Eastern-European '70s funk
movement, were toned down
with oceanic reverberations and
ethereal whispers of la-la-la and
Stereolab is their ability to really
get a crowd going, and at the
same time maintain a loungy
atmosphere for the seated few.
Bodies were swaying to the
rhythmic sound of drowning or
letting themselves be enveloped
in between the layers of the
nteracting vocals; but the cook-
e chiming and chirping of the
old-style organ always snapped
me back into the groove.
What's certain is that all is good
with Stereolab. Progressively, as
they cranked up the beats, I was
losing control over my composure and before you know it I
was doing my classic impression of an excited amoeba,
swooshing through the agar
plate that was the packed floor
of the Commodore.
Although caught up in the
trance of BEING in the LAB, I
had to leave in the middle of the
first encore 'cause of some
damned essay that would not
compromise. The word is that
jnd interactive
issues while remaining faithful to
the opera's sound. Challenges
include difficulties with ancient
instruments and a lack of castrati
(male singers with soprano
ranges attained by castrating
pre-pubescent lads, a practice
currently frowned upon).
December 4th's concert featured
two operas, The Garden of Love:
Venus and Adonis, by
Alessandro Scarlatti and The
Amazement by Dominico
Scarlatti at the Vancouver East
Cultural Centre. Many of the
challenges and rewards of this
endeavor were made clear for
listeners interested in this wonderful period in music.
The Garden of Love, circa
1703, was simple; Venus and
Adonis were separated in a forest, became depressed, and
then found each other to their
mutual   delight.   Nothing   else
because  the  music  was  very
good. The solution to the short
fully equipped v
her correct range while the fully
equipped man (meaning, not
castrated) was not. This being
the case, Adonis' heroic arias,
collected towards the end, were
the highlight of the show and the
The set designs were ambi-
mous barbed-wire roses and o
broken mirror stream — but the
roses mangled the English translations projected on a screen
behind the performers. This sort
of flaw appeared very avoidable, as did the wonky brass
playing, flubbing notes consistently throughout the opera's latter half. The rest of the playing
was at an extremely high level.

one of his full-length, more serious efforts.
Instead, his lovely trifle was

From Seattle, The
Gimmicks started the night off
with a hard rockin' set of fast no-
frills lotsa-attitude garage punk.
Next up was Portland's
answer to the MC5, but these
guys go way beyond the infa-
Detroit blues band of the
'70s. Crunching guitars,
opera, featured a libretto by
someone named Gigli which
was less sophisticated than an
episode of Three's Company.
The plot involved a male music
teacher infatuated with his
female student, herself considering running off to the big city
with a star castrato to start her
career before her training had
been completed.
Again, Lee was castrato-
cast. Dressed like a hybrid of a
'70s David Bowie and a birthday cake (the costuming was
fun) his range was abused and
neglected in favour of a soprano part. Phoebe MacRae was
fine as the student and Paull
Verhayen's performance as a
sexually frustrated, mincing
music instructor was the show's
best acting. Other than the
weird range experiment forced
once again on Lee, the singing
was not a problem. The members of the Pacific Baroque
Orchestra did a great job and
are not to blame for the utterly
empty musical space created by
the younger Scarlatti. The
Amazement was not written as
high opera, but its entertainment
value has disintegrated over
time. The music was almost nonexistent and the racy jokes were
simply unpleasant.

CHECKMATE
CONCISE
Monday, December 6
Commodore Ballroom
The crowd is always responsible
for whether a show is a success
or not... no one's going to have
fun at a jam that's full of herbs.
The first hip-hop act at the newly
renovated Commodore Ballroom
was well received. Heads lined
up for mad long to get in to the
much anticipated event —
though it would be a while
before the featured acts performed — but all were entertained by others and themselves.
I have decided that the
Commodore is the best place for
a hip-hop show: ample room for
dancing as well as good seating. My favorite part of the night
was what happened before the
show started. Dope old school,
rare groove, and underground
filled the venue, making heads
nod and b-boys break. What's
doper than b-boys breaking to
Ozomatli and James
Brown? I was impressed.
The opening acts were
Checkmate and Concise who
delivered Van City-flavored lyri-
endary hip-hop DJ playing a set,
schooling us on how he was a
hip-hop pioneer, playing more
music and schooling us some
more. Hmmm... this wasn't what
I thought it would be. Where
was "White Lines"? I was all
psyched to hear my old school
Furious Five classics like
"Superappin"' and "The
Message"; instead, I got
"Vibrant Thing" and "Jump
Around." Not that it was bad or
anything, but it wasn't anything
special. I had fun, the crowd
had a dope vibe, but if I wanted
to hear this stuff I'd go to
Grande or something. Highlights
of the performance were
Contents Under Pressure
performing on stage with Flash
and the various local emcees
freestyling. Mad love to the lone
B-girl and Ndidi Cascade for
blessing us with their gifts.
Another nice show brought to us
by G-man and Rizk.

CIRCA '77
THE COME ONS
THE ANTENNAS
THE BATTLES
Friday, January 7
Anza Club
gone terribly... right? Indeed,
the Circa '77 show was one of
the best shows of recent months,
and deserves extra props for
comprising all local talent. The
Anza Club was packed to overflowing on this Friday night,
with a very diverse crowd.
Some were in attendance to see
what The Battles could do to
Lou Reed's 8/ue Mask album,
some for The Antennas' tribute to Television's Marquee
Moon, some for The Come
Ons' version of the Clash's
self-titled album, and, it seemed,
still rr
s tho.
st for
jshofitall.
started off the
evening with something that
sounded an awful lot like a Lou
Reed song, but quickly deteriorated into a strange batch of
noise. Apparently, this band
hadn't quite had the time necessary to dissect and recreate the
Blue Mask sound. Oh well, it
remained an entertaining, if
somewhat short and incomprehensible, set.
Next up were the Antennas,
the band who spearheaded this
whole event. Last year, at about
this time, there was an attempt
made (quite successful, apparently, but I missed it) by some of
the Antennas to learn and perform a Luna album, and it
seems they liked the cover-band
routine so much that they went
at it again! I am a big fan of
Marquee Moon, and was
impressed with the choice —
this is what got me out to the
show. The Antennas did a bang-
up job of recreating the feel of
this late '70s album, with their
singer even pulling off a reasonable simulation of Tom
Verlaine's marvelous vocals. It .
seemed as though drummer
(and former DiSCORDER editor)
Paul t. Brooks was the show-
stopper, with his rock antics
impressing the crowds and inciting chants of "shirts off!"
throughout the set. The
Antennas stuck close to the original material, omitting one song
but succeeding in making the
music sound as good as it is
supposed to.
The Come Ons took things
one step further: they attempted
not only to play the Clash, but
to impersonate them as well.
The first few songs were peppered with wry British comments
and lots of "Oi!"-type shouts. A
very punk rock time was had by
all. The crowd even embraced
the spirit of '77, and were soon
throwing beer and trash-talking
the band like the best hecklers
of days past.
This night brought together
a diverse set of musicians. If you
missed out on Circa '77, you
probably won't get another
chance to hear the great music
that I heard that night.

SUPER FURRY ANIMALS
Mnwg2CD
Released for North America on Flydaddy Records,
SFA's fourth full-length Mnwg (pronounced
"Moong") features an entire bonus disc of unreleased
goodies. So get ready for that long distance phone
call from your obsessed European cousin, because
this quirky pop outfit is the toast of the UK indie-pop
scene! Sung entirely in Welsh, this enchanting collection of ballads deftly navigates through the influences
of '60s jangle-pop, 70s riff rock, and, of course, a little bit of dreamy '80s synth work. Mellowed song-
writing and nice instrumentation make this breezy pop
full length the perfect koot aid!

technology are in part a
i the functional
capacity of the technologies they depend on. This forms
an ambiguous relationship: On the one hand, this implies
a lack of humanity —- a pure technological imperative
and determination. On the other hand, the truth of technology is that it is ultimately social — an embodiment of
human choices, actions, and even ethics. A document of
this ambiguity, Ovatprocess is a collection of sounds
created via Markus Pope's own, and soon to be commercially available, audio-ptocessing software.
Supposedly, Poop's intention is to remove the centralising role of authorial direction, instead facilitating a diversified cyborg-like user/authot experience. Ironically, in
the meantime OVAt's music has never sounded better or
as challenging. Darker, more erratic, and far away from
the typical ambient template, or any OVAL copycat,
Ovalprocess fragmented sonic art conveys the depth-
less vertigo of the digital sublime. A Zulu favourite.
