THE BLAST NO TAX COUPON
Hey fool! Pay the tax on my purchase
when I present this coupon to you and
I won't tell a soul that this is your
highschool yearbook photo!
I promise, signed satisfied customer.  ATAHEAD
In Feb. of 1983 I was a grade ten
virgin with no direction in life and
one month away from a driver's
license—and what would later
prove to be quite an undesirable
driving record.. .bul that's another
slory. Now, l'ma25 year old self-
made hundredaire,the proud father
of a beautiful son and the editor of
the magazine you hold betwixt your
thumbs. Ten years ago I didn'l
even know whal a Discorder
was...hell, 3 years ago I could
barely pass my college Lit. class.
Bul as we all evolve menially, physically, emotionally, financially and
intellectually, so does Discorder.
For a magazine run by a staff
ofvolunteers, teny ears, in any one's
books, is a long existence. Throughout lhal existence Discorder has
made its mandate to not only emphasize music in its independent,
local and creative form but to
change; change in format, size,
style, technology and personnel.
Whal was once a one-piecefoldout
fanzine typeset at the Weslender
and then cut-and-pasted in the
Dis corder offices is now areknown
Northwest magazine completely
layed out on our own Macinloshs™.
More so than most magazines, change is an essential
characteristic—if not the life-
blood—of Discorder. This change
manifests itself most importantly
in two areas: ihe music and the
people. The heart of Discorder'j
content ts new music; writing about
music and Ihe musicians slill at
their rr
r trying I,
create something unique unto themselves. Without these musicians
and their music Discorder (and
CiTR) would cease to exisl...there
would be no reason for its exist-
Essentially, Discorder is a
reflection ofthe multitudes of people
who have worked on, advertised
in. been interviewed in, been reviewed in, wrote to, and read the
magazine. Each issue is only as
good as the efforts of its contributors, andalthough ne w contributors
are always emerging they never
seem to be in large enough numbers nor quickly enough. The
problems and barriers the magazine finds itself running into are
not exclusive to the current staff,
but were most definitely shared by
Ihe staff who got "That magazine
from CiTR radio" oul ofthe starting blocks, and will be shared by
future staff members to come. And
while people burnout, grow weary,
or are forced into exile, they are
replaced.
As Discorder'- first editor
was replaced so lo will I, and
therefore the need for nostalgic
reminiscence is meaningless. That
is why this issue isn't a glossy
commemorative of the past ten
years; Discorder ir concerned with
the present and the very near future. But as a toast to our forefathers
we've embraced the primitive techniques used by them for this 10th
Anniversary Issue of The Mighty

Thanks for the poem, allhough it did

Dear Airhead:
It was fun to read videophiltress
Tania Bolskaya scribe some good
old Discorder hypocrisy by putting
down David Lynch'sfilmsbyamock
fan statement then telling us to "keep
an open mind" in her last paragraph.
There is a difference between off-
the-cuff jabbering and a stated opinion. Leam about it sometime Tania.

Dear Airhead,
In January's issue some guy named
Sean O'Leary wrote you a letter. I
think his point was the Nappy Dugout has a rude name. Then again,
wasn't he saying Sparkmarker is
"the only great band in Vancouver
right now?" No, wait a minute, I
think he was writing to slag their
guitarist. I think our pal Sean had
some interesting info on the hidden
meaning of "Nappy" but once he
finished ranting about Shakey, I got
confosed. I don't know about all of
you out there but I'm just glad Sean
doesn't consider himself a fan of my
band. With fans like him, who needs
gig reviewers tocriti size you?Idon't
want to sign my name to this cause
I'm scared of this guy knowing who
I am and where I live. And I hope if
Sean's band ever gets an opportunity to play at the Nappy Dugout,
Shakey, as misplaced as his brain
may be, will remember the obvious
respect Sean has for him and his

TV DINNERS
Dear Airhead,
More and more space in Airhead
seems to be devoted to righteous
"alternative" folks denouncing "posers" and the recent popularity of the
punk scene. This is a narrow minded, even prejudiced, attitude that
relies on the premise that anyone
who has been into the scene for
longer than the next is somehow
superior.
These self-proclaimed gods of
(the) alternative feel justified injudg-
ing and denouncing others based
mainly on their (the others) appearance (can we be any shallower?) or
the length of time one has spent
wallowing in the alternative scene;
time served does not necessarily
equate with genuine appreciation.
Just how alternative is alternative? An alternative heirarchy has
sprung up, complete with superficial measures (Docs) to determine
one's altemative-ness. If punk #1
was digging Echo & the Bunnymen
when he/she was 12, and punk #2
was digging Suicidal Tendencies at
the same age, who is the bigger
hardcore? It has all become a distorted and absurd contest with very
little to do with actually enjoyin'
(the) music/lifestyle.
The point I wish to make by
dumping on the pretensions of seasoned punks is: if the music is good,
it is destined to succeed commercially, considering themselves the
only worthy audience is concieted.
It is true that many of the new converts to the "alternative scene" are
only blindly following a trend, as
they followed the last one (New
Kids on the Block) and will follow
the next one (Raves?),but there may
be one among them with the seal of
a true hardcore. If people would
concentrate more on the music at
gigs, rather than needlessly criticizing those around them it could make
the scene more enjoyable for everyone, and, perhaps, lend some credibility to the complaints of the hard-

Dear elitest scum,
My guinea pig died last night. How
come people have no respect for
smaller animals. We always think
bigger is better, whether it be animals or penises. That's probably
why wedo such horrible things to all
animals, we think because we are
bigger we're above them. Well I
loved my guinea pig more than I
love any human being! Every day of
the past four years he was there for
me. However bad things were going
I could depend on him to make me
feel better. He was like a squishy
giant, furry soother. Sure I have lots
ofhumanfriends, but they have Uves
of their own, he was just happy
living forme. I'll always remember
the way he used to squeak when I
brought him carrots and how his
warm body felt when he sat on me.
I'll miss you Geepy! Thank you for
listening to me.

I live in hell Port Alberni, Punk

if you could print this letter with
my address out here in the land of
salmon. In this hole in the wall
being a punk is a lonely life and
you behin to wonder if the whole
"scene" really exists with the only
sources of anything alternative
being Discorder, Coast 1040, and
Citylimits. We get to the cities
who know what mosh means about
once a month and if we're really
lucky, the so-called evil city of
Victoria during holidays, so if anyone feels like writing to let me
know I'm not just living a hallucination and feels like having a couple
of extra people to go partying wilh,

After you left I took
this road because you took
it because you wanted something other and another and
another and I, who wanted
to stand still, began to walk
in your steps to see what
you saw and why you
needed to see it. So far I
have had many another but
I have seen nothing. I hold
our dead love tight against
my face, the velvet against
my lips is yours, the thick
luxurious scent envelopes,
I see nothing but down into
the deep red convolutions.
The lovely petals press
against my face, below the
thomy thick stem tears my
hands, scrapes down my
stomach a faceless figure
kneels and grips, assuming
I see a face. I see nothing
but red petals, I feel your
velvet on my lips while a
faceless stranger touches me
too soon entering a vacant
building... strange new body
is only strange until you
know it. Thrill passes into
knowledge into repetition,
polished with practice, dead
as stone. Our old dead love
ismorealive than this transferred show of desire, this
favour for a faceless
stranger. Somewhere you
are doing this, but light
shines for you from their
faces and green life floods
your veins at their touch.
You see what you want to
see, that is your reward for
going first and dropping our
dead flowers at your first
step. In my narrow lane the
other finishes his work as I
risk a chance of seeing him
through my dead leaves but,
no, it's one of those dreams
where you try and strain to
see throughpinched lids and
cannot. I think it's all right
because it seems I am not
naked, there are cold damp
swathes of linen wrapped
tight 'round wrists and
ankles, pushed against my
sides, drawn up tight and
fi xed wi th a rose at my chest.
I tip my face down and inhale what was, because I
am not you.

^■^Anniwcriary PjSnc I Am An Egg
Many acting schools and theatre auditions demand that you convey the emotions of a rock, or the complex
hypertensions in a hard-Poiled egg. I have no desire to communicate either. Maybe that's why
I WATCH TV.
On TV there's no need to know how pieces of lint gyrate on meeting with the Bounce sheet in the dryer. No way.
I guess that's why I'm an actor and not an egg. I guess that's why I'm an
$$$$EXTRA$$$$
Watch our lips closely in the bar scenes when you catch a glimpse of us through the lead actor's inner thigh. WE
DON'T REALLY SPEAK TO EACH OTHER.
We have to be SILENT. If you get an ice cube in your mouth from your drink DO NOT CRUNCH IT. Swallow it whole, or
you single yourself out for a lightning bolt from the feathery director. When the cameras start it's either
"mdgsdsgsuiugdug" atthe date sitting across from you. or you look the little girl and her budding breasts straight in
the eye and say something far more exciting like:
•DO YOU REALLY HAVE A MIND-ALTERiNGLY LARGE CLITORIS???-
Definitely more exciting.
Note #1: In its Italian publications, this article is entitled "Tips for the Fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants Extra."
Your 13 year old date, who doesn't know what she's doing there except that she's got an agent and an angel
face that people seem to want to put on magazine covers (there's always a market for virgins) and they're sending
her to Japan on Thursday to get paid heaps of cash, be introduced to heroin and torn in two by a husky Swedish
footballer), is going. *What? What?" SILENTLY. That's the catch. SILENCE. Because she's afraid the BIG BAD director
might hear her voice and crack his BIG BAD cane over her wee knuckles. Sexual frustration abounds. Don't worry.
She'll keep quiet. No one is going to slap you.
My dream is that one day soon we'll unite. Before a scene, we'll all get together in a colourful mass, scarf the
doughnuts and decide on some funky moves. Whenever the inevitable token ethnic says a certain word we'll drink
our Coke, or rub our noses, or squint our eyes and show some teeth. You'll get a Sunday evening treat when your
parents sit around and make you watch this trash. They'll startto put warning labels atthe beginning of the showabout
acid and paranoia.
DON'T THINK THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU. JUST ENJOY THE SHOW. DON'T BE ALARMED.
There are so many bright, beautiful trailers, so much free food, and so many popular people that you could get
about anything you wanted if you orchestrated it properly. Hostages, etc.. There are so many opportunities for a
wonderful day. So many things could be done. There's usually only one security guard around (front gate. One at the
back too but he's harmless. Come round the side past the Toys R Us. Wear baggy clothing: W. Georgia Post Office,

But the money's good, so I remain.

"Clint Eastwood is welcome in
my house anytime" intones vocalist/guitarist Lance Leeder, one of
the two members of Vancouver's
Colour Clique. When asked what
person would be most likely to be
invited to dinner if reality be
damned. Lance Leeder pops Clint
Eastwood. Max Amason, Colour
Clique's keyboardist/percussion-
ist/drummer/vocalist ignores the
question like the weaklame-brained
idea it was. (And it wasn't mine, it
came from the N.Y. bestseller, Book
of A Hundred Questions.)
Colour Clique is described
as ambient/techno in feel. They
have two great songs off of the
KSM Records Raincreature compilation, a Vancouverindependent
artists collection. They are the first
band on the sleeve with "As We
Know It" and "You Had it Coming."
"It started as a technological
jam session," says Max in a faked
Oxfordian English accent, "under
the name Drill KKL and it just
sprung into existence from there
on in. We did two shows as Drill
KKL and then stopped, and that
was an interesting experience."
"It bombed," groans Lance,
"so we tried again on a compilation disc, Raincreature."
"We started working before
Raincreature, about four months
prior," says Max. "Raincreature
got us new material. We experimented with it, picked the ones we
liked, and so!"
"We got another compilation that we are tentatively doing
right now," explains Max. "We're
pencilled in to doing Bill Leeb's
(of F.L.A.) compilation. It's Bill's
and Michael Balch's pet project
and we'll have a couple of tracks
on there. Bill is putting it together
and it'11 be on Third Mind Records."
Influences? In his infamous
Edward Ka-Spel voice (The Tear
Garden) Max says, "Well, uh...our
influences are...ah, tentatively,
Ministry and...uh, smatterings of
MC 900 ft Jesus, and some people
say we even sound like the Beastie
Boys, but I don't know." His voice
trails off, "Lance?"
"As Colour Clique, we have
very diverse tastes. It's techno...so
Ministry? Right? Right. But me
being a guitar player I'm influenced by Hendrix."
"Yes," adds Max, "he likes
harder, more masculine, guitar
parts. As opposed to the drums,
and the keyboards, and the sort of
floaty, haunting beats."
I had to compare the band to
KMFDM and the Young Gods;
"Who?" says Lance.
Never mind.
There has been a debate on
whether or not industrial music
(or any other kind of music young
people like) is a reaction to anything. "Oi! It's artsy angry!" he
says with sarcasm. "Nah, I think
it's just what people do for fun. It
depends, a lot of people have different views on industrial music
for different reasons. We like to
do industrial music because it's
different, and what we wanna do
is create a hybrid style that's a
little longer lasting than generic
industrial music. It's not your basic 16-note keyboard slides and
'dadadadadadah!' It'sjustthat we
wanna create something that's got
more of a foundation and that's
going to be guaranteed to be around
for a little longer than a flash-in-
I told the band that Omni
Magazine wrote of people who
are into industrial music as being
chronically depressed.
"Hahahahaha! Terminally depressed?" says Lance.
"No, absolutely not, there's
just too much fun to be enjoyed
with all this," says Max. "We've
got no angry messages, no angry
youth, none of those stupid cli
ches! We do it for fun and we
really enjoy the music, we want to
eventually create something that
can change with the times; something liked by a world market rather
than one crowd. I want to appeal
to everybody. "
"There's a lot of messages in
our songs, but it's the way you
read into it," says Lance.
"We leave it open for any
interpretation, by anybody," adds
Max.
Apparently, those interpretations can get really side-tracked.
One person went up to Lance and
asked if they were a Nazi band
(when they were in Drill KKL).
"Yeah, Drill KKL! Achtung!
KKL doesn't stand for anything,
it's just three letters! But to most
people it was one letter away from
the New White Power!"
"Yeah,KIu Klux Lance!"says
L. Leeder. "That wasn't it at all.
And now, of course, we're Colour
Clique which is the opposite of
that! There's absolutely no racism
whatsoever but people can read
inlo it however they want as long
as they enjoy it."
I mentioned that I once read
an interview with William Rieflin
(Ministry) in which he stated that
his version of a true revolution
was for everyone to tum off their
T.V.'s and throw them out the
window. "That pretty much covers it," says Lance. " I hate to be
derivative, but lhat's brilliant."
I asked another question out
of that handy-dandy book of questions: most enjoyable dream?
(These are supposedly for psychologically evaluatingpeople...go
figure). "Ah, the most pleasurable
dream? I flew. I flapped my arms.
I don't know how it started but I
flapped my arms and I flew myself out of a German prison camp.
The feeling of being shot at and
actually escaping was the most
enjoyable dream I ever had."
Lance adds, "Mine was having Clint Eastwood over for din-
Regarding song titles, they
have no problem coming up with
them but they try not to be in the
usual industrial rut. "Anything, we
can use anything. We can twist
anything into a song title, like
'Flight of Demextreus.' We try
and stay away from the generic
one word album titles, like 'Gun'
or 'Doorknob' or 'Pinhead' or
'Blub,'" says Max.
When asked why they think
industrial music isn't as popular
as grunge, Max responds, "Well,
because there's a hell of a lot of il
and it needs to be reworked in
some ways. For instance, when
writing about love, it's a perfect
example of industrial music taking a turn and making itself bigger. [As industrial musicians] we
can write about tanks crushing
Vancouver does not bode well
for the two guys. "Vancouver is a
paperweight as far as industrial
music goes," says Max (echoing
Bill Leeb's and Rhys Filber's attitude about this city), "and no one
has any appreciation for it whatsoever. Industrial music, in order
for it to be successful, must go to
places like Europe or the States.
There's just too much of an influx
of bands coming into Vancouver
all the time. There's just so much
music here that people become
desensitized and numb to it. Industrial music is probably one of
the most ignored types of music."
"It's getting better, though."
says Lance.
"Oh, yeah, it's getting better. It's risen up faster in revolution than any other music style
I've seen. Industrial music has done
a complete turnaround. Most music goes out and comes back in 5
years. Industrial music has come
back in a year and a half with the
help of, I dare say, Ministry."
Lance and Max got their start
in music with a generic band, a
rock & roll band! Max on vocals
and Lance on guitar, "it was another interesting experience." (followed by cacklesof maniacal laughter) However, they didn't feel that
the music they were playing was
what they wanted. They wanted to
come up with something original
and new without rehashing other
people's work. "There's too much
out there that's derivative, we
wanted something brilliantly new.
I mean, lake Enigma, as soft as
that is, it's such an original idea.
It's brilliant. The first time I heard
Enigma I nearly dropped a load in
my shorts," says Max. "We wanted
to cover all areas of mood .aggression and happiness. We wanted to
write a song that could fit all types
of moods." Colour Clique plan to
break into more of an ambient
style to add to their already heavy,
guitar/techno sound.
Max talked about how he met
Mr. Bill Leeb. "I met that happy
little monkey 'cause I've known
Carylann (Bill's Fiance) fora while.
I can't remember where exactly I
met him but I had Carylann do
some photographs for a project

that anyone can sit, hunch up to a
song, and listen to something hardcore or take the flip side and just
They realize that as an industrial band the biggest popularity they could ever receive would
be cult status but, as Max says,
be industrial plus. I think Front
Line Assembly and Skinny Puppy
opened up a lot of doors forpeople.
I'd like to think F.L.A. and the
two side projects, Intermix and
Delerium, are good influences to
open up on. "
He adds, "You know, it's
really amazing how many people
are into Ministry these days, as
opposed to us who knew of them
in 1986 (when they were techno).
They're more of a death metal
outfit now and you got all your
Slayer fans out there who don't
know what they're about, or what
they were about from the beginning."
By the way, (and this is true)
Al Jourgensen has a penchant for
listening to Johnny Cash and he's
a DJ al a country and western pub
somewhere in the Midwest. I honestly didn't get the impression that
Al Jourgensen would have been a
top pick for dinner guest of their
dreams, but to industrial musicians
it still makes more sense then Clint
Eastwood. Why him? Says Lance,

) her place to pay her some

time that I met him. He's lotsa fun.
On his compilation we'll be doing THE BOO RADLEYS
What do you do when your record
label doesn't like yourmusic? Play
it for someone else. That's what
The Boo Radleys did. This band
from Liverpool, England formed
four years ago around a nucleus of
long-time chums. They were in
town a while back and gave us a
call. An interview was conducted,
and a bottle of whiskey was con-
Their first release was a mini-
album on Preston's Action Records
label which earned them the title
of "Britain's Dinosaur Jr." — a
moniker further encouraged by J.
Mascis' acknowledgment of them
as his favourite British band, followed by an invitation for them lo
open up for Dinosaur in Europe.
Rough Trade was lo release a few
singles and an album, but as far as
the band was concerned their relationship with this label was less
than ideal;
"We were always six months
behind where we wanted to be.
Singles couldn't be released because they couldn't afford to do it,
so we'd have to leave it for awhile.
Wecouldn'ttourbecausewedidn't
have anything to promote."
Why put up with this treatment?
Why allow some record label to
hinder progress? Read on Grasshopper, read on...
"It was getting pretly frustrating until finally we recorded
an album. We sent ihem Ihe tapes
and they said they couldn't afford
to market il. I don't think ihey
liked it. We never felt that Rough
Trade were behind us with our
EPs."
\I  Theta
/    They 1
\
The tapes of this unreleased album made their way to Creation.
They liked what they heard and
signed The Boos lo a big juicy
contract. The album has been released as Everything's Alright
Forever, which could be a reflection ofthe band's attitude towards
their current label (twenty-lhree
year old Martin Carr, between swigs
of whiskey and glances at his souvenir Richard Nixon Museum pamphlet, was more lhan willing to
disclose that at the age of sixteen
he was buying everything lhat Creation was putting out). Now that
the band has settled into more stable
recording arrangements, they appear ready to milk this to its full
extent. A four song EP Lazarus,
has already been released, a follow-up album is scheduled for the
spring, and confidence abounds;
"The new album has already
been written and it's a lot better
than Everything's Alright. We've
been listening to The Beach Boys,
John Coltrane, and Love."
Listening to the new EP these influences are obvious. At times a
little too obvious. But that's the
nature of good pop music and The
Boo's make no attempt to hide
their use of past popsters. Wearing Love t-shirts on stage, and
playing Pel Sounds before their
shows, they go out of their way lo
highlight influences. Studio musicians are, of course, hand picked:
"In the studio we've been
working with the guy who used to
play trumpet for Wham! None of
cw
is had heard him play but when
we found out he worked with
Wham!, we had to have him."
Playing with an ex-Whamster?
Whatever happened to image?
Style? Integrity? Admitting to this
sort of collaboration could have
serious effects! People^ will be
scrambling to trade in all their
BooRadleys stuff! A counter-cultural backlash a la Milli Vanilli
circa 1990! Disclosing this type of
highly classified information could
be the reason for the surprisingly
little press they receive, although
this doesn' t appear to bother them.
"We're glad about the amount
of publicity that we get because
•*£
most of the stuff that gets put in
the press is excess information,
stuff that you don't need to know.
Obviously when we do something
we want the press for it, but if you
get too much you're heading for a
fall at some point."
But what about the tour? North
American crowds? Bands?
"English crowds are content
to get really drunk, beat each other
up, throw themselves on the stage,
and jump on your pedals. But over
here people like to stand and watch.
I'm sure you get more out of the
performance that way. I don't care
either way as long as we get some
sort of response at the end. As far
as bands go, Mercury Rev
friends of ours and I think they ai
great. Pavement and The Flan
Lips are also good."
Try as I might, the only slag that I
could get out of Martin was a long,
drawn out "Booooooring" while
Kristin Hersh was onstage.
"Do you always wear green
shirts?"
Only whenl'm interviewing bands
that I really like, Martin my boy. I
guess it's time for me to consult

BO®! FOREVER
piscofebEf*^ Coffin Break formed some six years
ago, and while they were in the
midst of the burgeoning and much-
hyped Seattle scene, they don't
feel as if they really belonged with
the rest of the SubPop squad. Citing that they were both "too punk
and too melodic..." the band's influences are a mixed bag of rock
history, including Discharge,
Motorhead, Elvis Costello, Husker
Du, The Who, The Beatles, Minor
Threat, Ramones, and Led Zeppelin. — Epitaph bio
The following is conversation between Discorder's Grant Lawrence
and Coffin Break's Peter Litwin..
Grant: Hello, Peter...?
Peter: Hello?
Hi, it's Grant calling.
Oh, I was just calling you on the
other line! I'll just hang up this
namely because of yourextremeiy
vigorous and constant touring.
In fact, you've probably toured
Canada more than any other
American band I can think of!
Really? Wow, that's pretty cool!
WeU, we like it. We've been all
across Canada and the shows are
cool and people treat us really
nicely. The towns are pretty spread
out but the crowds are great when
we get there.
So, starting in Victoria, what'
the furthest east you've toured?
To Quebec City.
Hello? Hello? Ruskin! What the
fuck are you doing?
Nardwuar: He hung up on you!
Now, was that with Gwar?
Peter: No, on one Canadian tour
we went as far as Winnipeg wilh
Gwar. Things got kinda screwed
up on that tour, they all got sick,
then we got sick... I guess they
couldn't hack the Canadian cold,
even though they're supposed to
be from Antarctica!

Oh, Zef. So, is he working out or
are you going to fire him, or
Well he's gone, you piece of shit!
what? Why'd you get him?
Hello?
No, he's workin" out great. I've
always wanted a second guitar.
Oh... hello? Peter?
It's a little heavier, a little fuller.
Yeah.
Plus I'm not so great on the leads
Ok, good. Nardwuar'ssorta helping us out today. He says nice

That's not me! It's Rob! I just saw
that today for the first time.
Where was that?
The outdoorfestival, the Highwood
thing, Rob was naked.
So what'd you thinkof the mucho
talked about Highwood '92?
Besides all themass confusion and
how some of the bands got jerked
around, I thought it was great.
The new album sounds pretty
cool. Pretty poppy this time!
Yeah, pretty melodic, huh?
The cover is two ncwlyweds in
their marriage outfits, covered
in blood, looking into a picture
of themselves smiling and perfect. What in the hell does this
Well, kinda like they look into a

Your border situation is really
weird... you've got to cross alone
because you've got a goofy cop
record, right? And the other guys
drive up seperately but, Iron'-
...they got stopped at the border
for a really extended period of
time, like 6 or 7 hours. I went
across no problem.
And you actually ended up missing your time slot...?
Yeah, we missed it. so then they
changed us to go on right before
the headliner of thenight, the Dead
Milkmen, and we're all ready, we're
there unloading the van, and some
guy comes up and says "ok, you're
playing tomorrow at 10:00am." I
think our time slot was changed j
maybe 5 or 6 times. In the end we
played at about 4:00pm Sunday.
Crazy. Right before I got on the
line with you, Nardwuar refcrcd
to Coffin Break as "one of the
hardest working bands alive,"
One day I got a package in my
ally forlornly empty CiTR
mailbox from Dead Voices On Air's
Mark Spybey. It contained a letter
with the line "I used to be in a
British band you might've heard
of called Zoviet France." Had I
heard of Zoviet France?! They only
make some of the most beautiful
ambient music around. I listened
to the tape and was mightily impressed with its sophisticated
soundscapes. I quickly arranged
an interview with Mark and his
collaborator, Video Barbecue
member Scott Harker, which took
place in Mark's Kitsilano apartment, resplendent with his artwork
and hand made instruments.
Right off the bat, in a fit of
Canadian inferiority complex, I
asked Mark why he moved to Vancouver. "Have you been to England lately?!," he exclaimed. "It's
a bloody awful country. The political situation is dreadful. I've
worked in a lot of hospitals and
the health service was really good
in Britain, but it's been so severely cut back that it made my
life really difficult. The way I met
Scott was through a mutual friend,
he's in my profession and he's
also a musician that played with
Scott. So I contacted him and he
said 'come to Vancouver.' So it
was kind of a good idea! Six months
later, I ended up here."
Mark then filled me in on his
involvement with Zoviet France.
"I haven't been in Zoviet France
for about two years. In fact, I lost
touch with them for the usual band
reasons. I was pleasantly surprised
to see they have such a sizeable
following. I just moved into this
area and went into Zulu Records
and there on the wall was a Zoviet
France T-shirt. I was talking to the
guy in the shop and he said that
Zoviet France had played here.
All the record stores have CDs,
much more than you would find in
Britain. It's the same for stuff like
Skinny Puppy. They are big in
Europe, and so is FLA, and over
here they don't enjoy the same
success. It's a horrendous kind of
rock tradition that's so difficult to
I reinforce that thought by
saying that those bands really do
feelthat they aren't really appreciated here. "Oh good, I'd like to
hear about it from a musician,"
exclaims Mark. "I have raging arguments from people who aren't
, and when they hear I 'm
i they say: 'Phil Collins,
isn't he great!?' What a wanker!
That's one of the reasons I left
Britain...the last election. Phil
Collins said if Labour got in, he 'd
leave. Britain for tax exile, please
Back to Zoviet France, how
well do they do in Britain? "They
do okay. Until I joined them they
refused to do publicity and they'd
never played live. Can you imagine a band that only achieved what
they did through very ingenious
marketing ploys, which at the time
was to hand produce all their album sleeves, and to have a very
supportive record label, who was
willing to put money up front to
distribute their product. I was
amazed when I was in the band
because I'd got mail from all over
the world: Japan, Malaysia, South
America; crazy offers to play live
which they steadfastly refused to
do. They didn't feel they could do
justi ce to themselves. Ipushed them
and we did a couple of gigs—one
in Amsterdam which was quite
nice to do."
Mark then puts Zoviet France
in their musical perspective: "The
scene peaked when Zoviet France
came out, at the time when industrial music was in its heyday. We'd
just had the first wave of stuff like
TG [Throbbing Gristle], and the
Spits, and 23 Skidoo, and Portion
Control; all these sorts of bands.
So Zoviet France's first two or
three releases were pretty much in
that territory. They've become far
too musical for my tastes! Tome,
they' re a world music type of band
that use a lot of special effects to
create a still pleasing sound...it's
become something different from
the thing I'm actually interested
in, which is improvisation."
Both Scott and Mark feel that .
music should be "stimulating, direct and challenging. It should be
about issues that aren't easy to
deal with in other art forms," elaborates Mark. "'Baby I love you' is
a very tired, over-worked pop sen
timent, something I'm not interested in at all. I'd much rather deal
with issues of importance. Our
music is very personal and it's got
a lot of references in there that are
not easy to decipher. I prefer any
type of music that makes my brain
work and involves more than one
The emotional content, on
one hand, is important to Scott:
"There's got to be an emotional
content to the music, I don't have
to intellectually know where the
emotional content is coming from.
There should be a balance between
the emotional and intellectual."
Along with their preference
for improv, Dead Voices On Air
are definitely not into technical
overkill. "People tie themselves
in knots over the technical side of
music, it's bullshit," according to
Mark. "Some ofthe worst excesses
are tied to that kind of thinking.
The reality is that music is accessible to people, music making as
well, because il's concerned wilh
creativity. Everyone's creative,
everybody's gol the ability to do
the things we're doing, it's whether
or not you want to do it, ulti-
Scott explains that they record
everything they do but, because
they improvise, the first time he
hears a Dead Voices On Air recording it's completely new. This
is differentfrom other bands where
a song is rehearsed to death. "I
thought this is good, but what will
it sound like after repeated
listenings? It's standing up for me
in a way I never thought it would
necessarily, which is exciting?"
Mark sums it all up: "I underestimate the Zoviet France link
but we have a lot of faith in what
we're doing. I'm confident at the
end of the day the product we did
is good, exciting and it's inventive." Dead Voices On Air is definitely all of those.

The Offspring's music is punk.
It's rock too. Damn.it's hook filled,
melodic and catchy as hell. Their
latest offering, Ignition, on Epitaph could be one of 1992's best.
A modem day classic. Each song
better lhan the one you heard before, or so it seems, yet every song
that preceded better still. Ignition
is a strong, powerful and consis-
So, it does strike me as somewhat strange lhat The Offspring!
have been around now for about |
seven years and have still n<
ally received the attention they,
justly deserve. Will Ignition finally break The Offspring's curse
and let them be heard by the masses?
I hope so. Read on friends....
The Offspring is:
Noodles — guitar
Greg K. — bass
Ron Welty — drums
Dexter Holland — vocals
Discorder: I guess we should start
with the fact that The Offspring
have a new record out on Epitaph. How did that come around?    _
Dexter Holland: WeU...we begged (y
them actually! We recorded for a
compilation called The Big One
on Flipside and wc did il at West
Beach. That's how we met Brett
[Gurewietz, of Bad Religion andi
Epitaph Records], because lhal
their studio. We just happened
record for lhat compilation therej
and then we hit him up, this w
about a year ago, and he turned
down eventually. We thought "Oh,
shoot!" because we thought we
had a chance wilh them.
Then we had an offer from
Lookout! Records and it came to
the point where we just decided
"Well, the hell wilh il, we're just
going to sign with the best thing
we can get." So we sent out to a
bunch of labels. I went to a record
store and looked in record bins for
labels. We mailed out to about
twenty of them. We even mailed
out lo Epilaph thinking lhat we
didn't have a chance because ihey
had already turned us down, but
they actually called and said "Well,
maybe wc might be interested, but
you've got to send us a demo of
new stuff."
We really hustled it out, wc
didn't even have the songs written. We got together and in a few
days we pulled all of those half
songs into songs. We didn't have
lyrics or anything! We went in and
demoed itandljustsangnonsense
lyrics, I didn't even have time to
_>x*c©cj_>efc.
make up
them the tape of that and they
really liked the songs. They signed
us just based off of that. We
into the sludio about a month I;
when I had
lyrics, and we did the real thing
u chose Thorn Wilson as your
leallofourrecordsforu
en his name on all of tl
I had seen hi
old Orange County stuff, the punk
stuff, thai used to come out — he
produced all, of lhat old stuff:
T.S.O.L, the Vandals, Adolescents
— and just from those records I
decided that I would like to look
. him up. It wasn't easy finding hi
I A guy who used to help manage i
helped us find him. We just hiti
- him up, sent him a demo tape and
happened to get really lucky because he works in TV, but he has
an off season and he likes to do
records occasionally. So... we just
happened to hit him up at the right
time. It worked out well, so he
hasn't minded working with us
You obviously work well together
because the new record c
out sounding very good!
Thanks! He's really up on his chops.
He'll do stuff for MTV, c
while they'll ask him ti
"Unplugged" thing, it's just weird
stuff that he still does. Hew
there and did that... umm... what's
lhat "Silent Lucidity" band? Do
you know who I'm talking about,
that awful heavy metal band? I'm
sure if you ask someone they'll
on MTV all the ti
He did them and someone like the
Scorpions. He does stuff like that
and he did the MTV Music
Awards...all kinds of crazy stuff.
He's still really good at his
id. We're really happy aboul
it because sometimes people say
all the Epitaph stuff sounds the
same.Bbecause Brett is involved
with a lot of production there is a
similar production style on a lot of
it. Brett was actually really happy
to have someone else produce il. Il
made it sound a little different, I
think, from olher Epitaph releases.
Yeah, everything worked out great!
Doyou think that has to do with
the fact that it is on Epitaph?
Yes. As far as we're concerned
we're selling wayi
sold before. When our firsl album
sold 2000 of them.
This one shipped 9000. It's up to
just over 10,000 now. We've sold
many records, it's
:dible!  Almost no Epitaph
record sells under 10,000.
That definitely helps you out a
lot. What are the chances of having your first record that was on
Nemesis re-rcleased on Epitaph?
I' ve approached them about it, and
we have talked about it, I'm not
really sure if it is going to happen.
Epitaph doesn'i
ed as snakeslhat <
try to scoop up other people's
records. So it is on hold but it is a
possibility I guess. I would like to
see it happen because it neve
out on CD, Nemesis didn't have
T5f
thing other than album and cas-
. Now I feel we could probably sell s
Do you think your new record
has helped you break your
"curse"in L.A.?
...of anonymity? I don't know yet!
They say it takes a good three or
four months to let it permeate and
get oul there. We' ve played a couple
of shows lhat have went really
well...I can't tell if we are going to
draw a lot of people the next time
we play. I think it is going lo Uke
us a while before we can tell if
anything is going to happen or
not. Everyone seems really positive aboul it. It seems Uke all of
the reviews have come in good.
Do you see L.A. as a place where
a band can be huge but be nothing anywhere else?
Yeah, look at Oingo Boingo! It
happens but usually it is the opposite, where they hate you in L.A..
I don't know what it is but I think
the people in L.A. are innundated
with music. It's a tough crowd lo
please.
That may have been your problem in the past?
Maybe, maybe. It's somuch easier
when you go out on the road and
people are happy that you even
and play their town. It was
lly weird, a totally different
ngc ir
tudc.
Doyou think we'll beseeingThe
Offspring on the road and hitting Vancouver at all in the near
1 hope so! I'm sure we're going to
be louring in the summer. The last
hit Seattle but we've never made
il to Vancouver. Someone said
it's a hassle getting across the border unless you're planning to stay
in Canada for a few days. I hope to
really good things aboul it from
Berkeley. They're like "Oh, man,
you've got to go up there and play.
It' s so good up there." Is it as good
as Ihey say?
o be objective
It's hard for m<
on that point!
We're actually really lucky this
next month! We're going lo play
with NOFX in L.A. and two Bad
Religion shows. One show is at
the Santa Monica Civic and it has
a 5000 capacity.
Is it frightening because of the
amount of people, or the potential for disaster?
All of that! You're just thinking
"Man, if we suck tonight we are
going to live it down." A
little, tiny show in front of fifty
people is almost like "Who cares?"
How are you ever going to gel pasl
that kind of wrath ifyou do badly?
We were lucky though, it went
Do shows that large tend to be
violent?
Yes! L.A., in general, is a little
more violent than a lot of places.
More violent than places like Berkeley and some other cities, but in
a way less violent than some places
like Fresno. They're sort of caughl
in "skinhead-ism." There's some
people that are jusl drawn to the
violence of it ralher than the music. Thai's not really what il's about
at all, and that sucks.

Kristin Hersh is truly a muse of
this modem world. She alchemizes
all the pain and suffering that she
observes into beauty and magic
Her songs are stories, pieces of
people's lives, a document of this
time and place. She says that the
songs take us on a ride and that we
must take this ride no matter what.
I believe Kristin is more than just
a vehicle for this trip and that she
does not merely play a passive
This interview is based on a
recent phone conversation that I
had with Kristin while she was on
the band's American tour. She appeared to be happy and very excited
about the new album, Redlleaven,
the new band and the birth of her
son, Ryder. I believe that Kristin
is one ofthe most important voices
in modem music so I let her tell
the story.
Discorder: It has been an incredibly productive year and a half
for you with the birth of Ryder
and Red Heaven...
Kristin Hersh: They don't feel dissimilar either. Ryder is on the road
with us now so the juxtaposition is
in my face all of the time and it's
nice to have something physical,
like Ryder, with all that work going on with the band. There are
good pictures of bolh things. I am
lucky lo have them and I am so
proud of each one, but I don't
sleep much, (laughs)
Neither do your songs.... Then
Tanya left.were you nervous
about the next project?
She never actually left, we just
dissolved as a band when wc were
making The Real Ramona. I wasn't
interested in being in the music
business any longer. It is the same
old story of doing somelhing that
you care about and having to deal
with the music business bullshit. I
was weak for a while and I didn'l
want to deal wilh it anymore because they are like my kids, these
songs, and I couldn't watch them
being kicked around then thrown
back in my face—I had completely
lost focus.
I had started the band on my
ui.n,
jusl pulled out and didn't really
care anymore. I was a little bit
bored with the last two records
and breaking up seemed like a
tOOJLfl
They are fine songs, good personalities, but I couldn't make them
happen. I think, as a four-piece,
you inherently lack dynamics because you present this wall of sound
that you can't afford to let drop,
but can't build from either. So our
intricacy was mainly in the counter-
rhythms and counter-melodies, but
we didn't have the dynamics that
Is it difficult for you to sing those
earlier, painful songs, night after night, due to the emotional
factor?
Yeah, but that's my job. "Hate My
Way" is painful, but freeing. I
don't think that I have any song
that is pessimistic. Each song, no
matter what it deals with, takes
you on its ride and even though it
doesn't explain anything, at least
it doesn't take you down.

good idea to all of us. We were
excited. I didn't know what I was
going to do. I had to find out afler
a year plus lhat the songs kept
coming whether I was in a band or
not. The songs alone are what made
me strong again. I needed to put
ihem down and get them out, and
I couldn't imagine working with
anyone but Dave. We brought
Leslie Langston back to do the
record because we knew that this
record needed a raw, immediate
treatment.
What direction are you going in
We're a trio, a sound that I was
looking forfor a long time. I didn't
know it but we are finally able to
do old songs, that I could not make
happen as a four-piece song, from
our first couple of records that
people ask for at our shows. My
answer [to requests before] would
be, "No, I'm not 17 anymore."
I must be an exception, but I can
see how the songs are cathartic. ..how you can figu re out what
you are feeling and then get it
out of your system.
You have to take that ride because
it's there. You are going to do it
anyway so you might as well do it
in a safe place like music. Like the
song "Mania," that is the same
deal, it's crazy and sounds like all
of this awful stuff, but as soon as
So iell me about Red Heaven.
That material all came in a big
blast of three months. It is like I
said, I had learned that it was great
and that was my kick in the ass to
start a band; that caring so much is
a strength and not a weakness.
The live show sounds pretty much
like our record. We produced this
one because we couldn't have anyone stepping on it, not because it
was fragile but because we knew
linear direction, but this one
pushes it that much further.
Do you really think so? I do. The
Real Ramona was heavily produced, this one needed a live sound.
We couldn't afford to present this
as a band playing in a room and
then start lying...me singing with
myself and all of these pins and
pons dropping in. We put the drams
in a giant room and we didn't gate
them. We put mikes everywhere
and used that crazy spilling over
sound. We played the guitars
through four crazy old fuzz boxes
and the singing was the same way
(experimental). People always say
that "when you're singing quietly
you get up into the mike and whis -
per, but when you scream, you run
away from the mike." Whenever
the song would reach a climax I'd
be on the other side of the room!
So I just screamed into the mike
and the meters went crazy like we
knew they would.
How did you meet up with Bob
Mould? I remember reading
about how you were a big fan of
his and then he appears on your

it's important that yoi

so dance to it. That's what you do.

you that hard. It is not your job to
kill yourself.

Real
When you write songs are they
already produced in your head,
the type of sounds that you want
etc., or are they produced in pre-
production?
It depends. Sometimes a song will
come just as lyrics, the guitar part
and the melody but, for the mosl
part, it's just something that I hear
so I have to make sure that we do
the right sound fixturings, as groovy
as that sounds. So, usually, I am
working in my own studio with
the drum machine, playing bass,
guitar and vocalizing. I make a
record even before we actually
make the album.
That saves you a lot of money.
Yes, it does, and it also saves you
from that horrible stress when you
get into the studio and you are
thinking too hard.
I think that Mary Margaret O' Hara
Really!? You are so much alike,
vocally.
My baby loves her record. We call
it the stun gun because no matter
what is going on with him, we can
putonherrecordandhejustfreezes.
I like Pond a lot, we toured with
them in Europe.
You once said that your songs
are based on characters that take
up your head. Are any of these
characters based on people that
you met and had conversations
with, or read their stories and
were moved by them?
They could be a combination of
all of those things. It's what sinks
in from the works, bul only what
matches with what is way down
inside you. I wouldn't say, "Oh,
she's just like me, I will write for
the ladies now." I am always behind what the songs have to say
bul I think lhat all of those little
pieces, and what's way down inside me, all come together in the
songs. It seems like magic lo mc
and I think that's why songs can
be religious, because ihey make
the work more beautiful than it is
and they know a little more than I
do. The songs are based on pieces
of people's lives. If people did a
hard job or an appropriate job in
their lives then their stories come
with a little bit of magic.
What about people who are dying from Aids, who are
courageous through the torture
of the disease, etc.?
Getting through it is the important
thing because pain happens to
anyone, indiscriminate whether
they are good or bad. Happy people
are truly magic. You can not be
happy having been comfortable
your whole life. But you can be
very, very clean having felt all
that stuff and that's what happy

KITCHENS Or DISTINCTION
Wed.Feb.IO—
Commodore
EH The first column of the
year—yippee! Let'sgotoit,boppers.
First up is Meat Beat Manifesto's
latest, Satyricon (Mute). It opens
promisingly with the subsonic ambient "Pot Sounds," which is then
followed by the dance heavy "Midstream." But Jack Danger's vocals
threw me off, he's actually singing"
more than he is shouting, which
makes the song sound more generic.
"Drop" however, has a hypnotic dublike bassline and the vocals are more
akin to days of yore.
"Your Mind Belongs to the
State" features interviews with
people talking about the end of the
universe, their own mortality and
insanity definitely more interesting
samples than used in most dance
stuff while "Circles" employs African percussion and samples of frogs.
In "Edge of no Control," a member
of Consolidated phones Jack Dangers and leaves a message on his
answering machine: "This is Mark.
I'm at the studio and I wanna give
you some BPM - we got 177, we got
93, 94.5, 112." A loud, humorous
groan is heard after the list.
Satyricon is certainly
smoother than their earlier releases
but I must admit I miss the rawness
and the noisiness. However, on re
peated listening there are signs of
the earlier Meat Beat. I wasn't too
keen on this at first but it flows
together well I might even pick it up.
Next up is Pigface's newest Fook (Invisible). Way more fo-
cussed than Pigface's earlier releases
it starts off with what sounds like
Led Zeppelin coming through a
badly tuned transistor radio, then
slams into a hard-coreish song! Insane and intense vocals by
KMFDM's En Esch bass by Rollins
Band's Andrew Weiss, and ex-Killing Joke Paul Raven make this an
awesome opening.
"Ten Ground and Down"
features Silverfish's Lesley Ronkine
on vocals; her voice is filled with
barely concealed rage. Chris
Connelly pulls vocal duty as well, so
it's the Scottish accents from hell,
and Barbara Hunter plays a cello,
which greatly adds to the tracks feel-
Ogre's touring with Pigface
has improved his voice markedly -
he uses no distortion - and on "Insemination" his oblique poetry is
highlighted. Not to be outdone is
Martin Atkins' complex drumming...
One of the best tracks, however, has
to be "Hips Tits Lips Power," again
with awesome vocals by Ronkine.
It's an ode to female power that has
the strength of a bulldozer, due
mainly to the double guitars of Fu zz
and En Esch, the vocal accompaniment by Mary Byker, as well as
blasts of programming. Fook ends
with "I Can Do No Wrong," a noisy
tune highlighted by Connelly's rather
nasty look at himself. He writes some
of the best lyrics, he's not afraid to

Christ" is fast with guitars and reminds meof Babyland, while "Wash
Your Brain" has a staccato rhythm
over a good bassline and a good
sample: "Brains are filthy and they
need a good washing." Ifyou can't
find this in record stores, here's the
address: Box 500, 44 South

As you may have read elsewhere in Discorder, Dead Voices
On Air is comprised of ex-Zoviet
Nextupis the Deprogrammers' latest casseue. Wash Your
Brain. The Deprogrammers believe
that the general populace is brainwashed by the cult of materialism,
whose basic precepts are the fact
that there is no God, that life comes
from matter, and that people satisfy
their whims and urges of the body,
no matter what. The two members
have become followers of
Vipramukhya Swami and are on a
France member Mark Spybey and
Video Barbecue's Scott Harker, and
they live here in beautiful Vancouver. I have two tapes of their's and,
unfortunately, I missed their performance at Sonic Boom, an electroacoustic concert put on by the Pro
Musica Society. Themusic will definitely appeal to Zoviet France ap-
preciators but DVOA puts more
emphasis on improvisation. Unfortunately, DVOA haven't released
anything yet but plan to perform
either this month or in March. Stay
tuned to Mekanikal Objekt Noize,
the radio version (Mondays 1:15-
3pm), for more details.
Hey, it wouldn't be a column without yel-another-Front-
Line-Assembly release! This time
it's Rhaze Two by Intermix (Third
Mind), FLA's dance-friendly side
project. I just got a copy so I haven't
had too much time to listen to it, but
it's fun and definitely on the light
side. It includes the 12" song " Dream
On," (I enjoy the nine minute track
better) and "Monument," which has
a fat, reverb bass line that hooked
me in. "Monument" and "Truth"
however, seem to be more suited to
the Delerium project than this but,
overall, enjoyable.
In other local news, Tear
Garden (Cevin and Dwayne of
Skinny Puppy and Edward Ka-spel
of the Legendary Pink Dots) has a
video for "Sheila liked the Rodeo"
(Nettwerk), as well as an EP that
should be out in March. Nettwerk is
also working on a release package of
Skinny Puppy'svideos which should
include some cool stuff involving
look honestly at himself, especially
on his solo albums. I do miss the
experimentation ofthe other Pig face
releases but this will probably be
more accessible to people put off by
Pigface's erraticness.
I've also become the recipient of some local releases from
people doing electronic music in
Vancouver, believe it ornot. First up
is Billy Gets Left Behinds Small
the "Warlock" video and live stuff.
That's it for now....

Ok, so we're a bit disorganized this month, to the point where
Kim didn't actually get around to
submitting anything, but at least we
got the fucking thing done, right?
It's probably pretty obvious Coral
and Redd aren't doing the "Special"
anymore and since I'm not really
sure how they approached it I can't
say we'll be picking up where they
left off. However, we do hope to
cover whatever we can concentrating specifically on the Vancouver
independent music scene, of course.
If you want anything to be reviewed
in this column send stuff to "Van
couver Special" c/o Discorder. I
promise that everything that gets i
sent in will be reviewed. However, I
if you are going to send stuff in, fuck
off with the promo shit. A little
background info about the band
sometimes helps but I could care
les s about pouty promo shots or acres
of drooling rock n' roll jizz about
how great the band is. I can listen to
the tapes myself thanks. As for the
reviews themselves, I'll do my best
to try and describe the musical content but I won't apologize for any
mildly obnoxious opinions I may
STEPPIN' ON GRANT'S

One can only admire the total
irreverance the new Evaporators
7" shows for "serious" musicianship. Amidst the fuzzed out noise
one would expect from an Evaps
release arise a surprisingly number
of great songs. Standout tracks for
me are the screechy yowlings of
"Welcome to my Castle" and the
60's punk stomper"Pregnant" overlaid by a fine Mudhoney-inspired
buzzsaw guitar sound. There is, of
course, the obligatory insulting I
Nardwuar interview snippet and excellent full-colour packaging.
LOCAL DEMOS
The Walk bravely venture
into the little traveled world of Blue
Rodeo-inspired, light, jangly pop
tunes. It's quite well done but listening to this type of music for too long
makes me want to bash my head in.

On the same note somebody
should've told Castrated Turnip
that it is an extremely bad idea to
cover a Ramones song and do it
slower than the original. Fourth-rate
pop punk.
The next time I get the urge
to listen to bad rock'n'roll/retro-
metal with masturbatory, technical,
guitar-wank overtones I'll know I
can find it in Rotor Cloud (Rah
Talent, #71-1665 Robson St., Vancouver, B.C., V6G 3C2). I'm sure
there's a huge audience for this kind
of gutless drudge. And if Sadistic
Humor (c/oSean Luciw,#65 -1605
Summit Dr., Kamloops, B.C., V2E
2 A5) is trying to parody some of the
cheezier aspects of metal I'd say
they've succeeded with their repeti-
tivechugga-chuggaspeed-metal riffs
everyone's heard before, their
obligatory ballads and, of course,
the lyrics about gambling with the
reaper and slaying dragons.
Aaronation ($6 post, paid,
313PineSt.,Mt.Vemon,WA,98273
USA) play raw, blistering hardcore
that reminds ofthe mighty Rorschach
except the lyrics display a high degree of frustration and self-centered
personal rage. Similarly, the newest
tape from Victoria's Contempt has
a definite raw, early Black Hag feel
to it, except the song structures are
more complex and the lyrics more
explicitly political. Very punk.
Elephants Child — A bit
of Dinosaur Jr. in the guitar work
and Northern Pikes in the harmonies. The music is well crafted but it
doesn 't have enough guts to be anything more than sedate college-rock.
(5250 Chesham Ave., Bumaby,
B.C..V5H2L2)
Paste, however, have
forged a heavy, raw-edged guitar
sound on this tape that is complemented perfectly by the singer's full-
throated vocals. If he'd concentrate
more on yelling the songs the tape
would be better overall since his
miserable attempts at singing end up
sounding like a bad version of Shut-
Kar/nij play controlled, hectic thrash with low, growly vocals
and intelligent, personalized lyrics.
Tempo changes and interesting
riffing raise this above the ordinary.
(5949 Clarendon St., Vancouver,
B.C., V54 3K4)
Georgette Fry—I've been
told this sounds a lot like Bonnie
Raitt with a country twang to
it..sounds like a big pile of shit to
me. Imagine boring lounge music
with a severely watered down blues/
country sound and the kind of beat
that is so sedate it can be danced to
withoutmovingyourfeet. (P.O. Box
22007, 343 Wellington Rd., London , Ontario, N6C 4N0)
Spice of Life — If your
idea of hip happenin' rock 'n' roll is
Pearl Jam-induced, 70's throwback
retro-metal with smooth production
lines and absolutely zero energy you
may find yourself able to rock out to
this instantly forgettable tape. Yawn.
(Suite 101 - 1184 Denman #145,
Vancouver, B.C., V6G 2M9)
The Falcons — Instrumental guilar a la Shadowy
Men...except more laid back and
with a slight country twang. Very
cool. (35 - 2137 W. 1st

(T^^Q      FrL: noon to 8:0°Pm-
Sat. & Sun.; 11:00 a.m. to 6=00 pm. I recently returned home from a
weekend jaunt to Oregon and while
there saw/partook in some shows
and stumbled across some Orego-
nian 7 inchers. The first is from an
act called Roger Nusic and Conceptual Balls. I saw Roger and his
band play at the X-Ray Cafe in Portland and it was quite an experience.
Roger Nusic is apparently some sort
of local hero in Portland, somewhat
comparable to our own Nardwuar
the Human Serviette. Like Nardwuar, Roger Nusic dawns startling
stage apparel (usually a long, flowing gold cape) and cranks out some
fairly disturbing rock music. Unlike
Nardwuar, Roger Nusic is a heavy-
duty Christian.
The two songs on the Roger
Nusic single are equally as bizarre
as the Uve performance. "Spiritualized rock and roll music" could be a
fairdescription... groovy rythms under the wailing, banshee-like vocals
of Nusic. The songs are very long as
they are strange, and coupling that
with a pretty bad recording jobmakes
this stuff fairly hard to swallow even
in a humorous light. The B-side,
"What Is The Name," is their super-
religious sing-along hit: "What is
the name we want to hear? JESUS!
Oooooohoooowhoaaaaooo
JESUS!!!" You gotta give Roger
some credit for having the"Balls" to
put this out.... (Hello Lovers, P.O.
Box 1661, Tualatin, OR, 97062,
USA)
Down in Eugene, Oregon, at a
club called John Henry's, I saw a
local band called Compost who
gave me their new/debut 7". Sorry,
not into this sorta stuff. I don't want
lo totally slag this cuz they were nice
guys but I find their music to be
slow, moody, and just downright
depressing. Side two starts to get
going and is kinda "nice" but it's
nothing memorable, as was their
live show albeit a lot heavier and
louder. One interesting point is that
all the cover art is different as the
singer's dad owns a print shop. (954
West Third, Eugene, OR, 97402,
USA)
Now why in the hell do I even
bother leaving Canada when such
great stuff is being put out here?
Authority Fails, a new Quebecois
catchy and ultra-Canadian. They
sing/shout in both English and
French, with song themes strongly
rooted in the anarchy/justice/peace
department. Lots of rock and roll
elements shine through, topped wilh
the singer's familiar hoarse punk
growl. The music is good and their
message comes across lound and
clear: everything's rotten. Best Canadian hard-core I've heard in ages.
(En Guard, 1671 St. Hubert, Montreal, PQ, H2L 3Z1)
Canada" note, Nardwuar Records
has released two singles in a salute
to Canada's 125th birthday of 1992
under the title "Nardwuar Canada
125 Birthday Series." The first is
from Nardwuar's own combo The
Evaporators who, after being a
band for over seven years, have finally released their own piece of
vinyl! And it's excellent; four solid,
crazed rockers of "pure teenage zit
rawk angst" that leaves the listener
flabcrghasted and bewildered after
1, kick a
furious hard-core punk lhat's ultra
each spin. This record's demented,
amazing sound, along with its top
notch packaging and hilarious liner
notes, make it a true milestone in
Vancouver's rock and roll history.
Also out from Nardwuar is
Britain's Thee Headcoats Canadian debut, where lead singer Billy
Childish pays tribute to early Canada's only true folk-hero and rebel,
Louis Riel. As is with most all of
Thee Headcoats' stuff, both sides
are stompin', rockin', and suave in
high garage rock fashion. My only
complaint here is that the cover art
isn't quite up to Nard-par but the
liner-notes on Louis Riel
by Pierre Berton specifically for this single!) make up for it.
(Nardwuar Records, P.O. Box
27021, 1395 Marine Drive, West
Vancouver, BC, V7T 2X8)
Man, some of the crap I get
sent...! Pieces of Lisa's new 7"
sounds like a cyberpunk version of
Quid Riot mixed with Rush wilh
heavy funk overtones. And if
anyone out there thinks lhat is an
attractive description please stop
reading, rip ihis column oul of the
magazine, and kindly wipe your ass
with it. Q: What's the difference
between Pieces of Lisa and a bucket
of shit? A: The bucket. (Greedy
Records, 1280 4th Ave., #4, San
Francisco, CA, 94122, USA)
who also play host to one of my most
favorite bands around, the infectiously rockin' Magnolias. Bul, alas,
t'was another waste of my bloody
lime. Must I explain what ihey sound
like? Must I go through the motions
of critiquing this? Can I even possibly be objective? Can't I just review
records I like? No. Cerebral Corps
are a band lhat can't seem to decide
what in the hell they want to do.
They use a ton of fx and consequentially come out sounding much like
The Beatles' circa Magical Mystery
Tow. Since my likeness for them
Beatles loses its steam right around
Revolver, Cerebral Corps can join
Pieces of Lisa on shit detail. (Alias,
2815 West Olive Ave., Burbank,
CA, 91505, USA)
Wiping all that negative slurring aside, make room for Girl Trouble's fabulous debut on eMpTy
Records! It's a tribute to Girl Trouble's resident go-go dancer, thee
Granny Go-Go. For those of you
unfamiliar with the Granny, this
woman is an 82 year old professional go-go dancer who, over the years,
has appeared on stuff like The Cong
Show, Merv Griffin, and the Jerry
Lewis TelethonVA Now she spends
her golden years in smoke-filled.
Also from San Franci
month, but thankfully not as easily
comparable to a lump of steaming
shit, is Penelope Houston. Old-
schoolers may remember this woman from her days of fronting the
premier San Francisco punk combo
The Avengers in the late '70's/early
'80's. Her latest 7" is just Penelope
Houston "and her band" and is radically different from anything The
Avengers ever di d. Th is sin gle' s two
tunes are both cool, country-flavoured, bluegrass beat stuff, sorta
sounding like a cross between the
Violent Femmes and the Picketts.
All in all, a coupleof good songs that
are genuine and different. (Doki
Records, P.O. Box 49593, Los An-
gcles, CA, 90049, USA)
sardine-packed Seattle clubs, up on
stage with Girl Trouble, doing a
"good shimmy" to GT's trademark
rock and roll groove!
On the A-side of the single
Girl Trouble punk it out about how
Granny can "Work Thai Crowd,"
complete wilh a spoken word from
Granny over Kahuna's guitar solo!
Plus the sleeve is covered with humorous and "revealing" photos of
Girl Trouble and Granny Go-Go in
action. As with any of Girl Trouble's incredible records ihis is a musl
have. (eMpTy, P.O. Box 12034, Seattle, WA, 98102, USA)

Finally, Fastbacks... there
ain'l much of anything new that can
be said about Kurt Bloch 's dinosau-
rock band lhat hasn't already been
printed and reprinted. They're slill
great and even though ihis single
isn't in the traditional supcr-fast-
insta-pop-hil-must-be-Fastbacks
mold il's slill damn fine. I will now
attempt to describe the songs: side
one is a soberingly drunk mid-tempo anti-anthem while side two blasts
off with the stature of a nursery
ryhme, into a long, quiet drum solo,
and then turning inlo an instrumental thai Clint could have used in
Unforgiven. Yeah, yeah, I know, 1
sapointed by
my next selection from The Odd
Numbers. I heard a greal tape of
their's while in Eugene and set oul lo
find some of their apparently existing vinyl. What I found was a four
song EP entitled From Cradle To
Grave. Now maybe I was really
drunk or something but The Odd
Numbers ain't quite as hot as I recalled. Like the great E-Types I
talked about last monlh, the Odd
Numbers take on thai mod-stylin',
Jam-inspired, three-chord power
pop. With those sort of ingredients
I'd usually love it but in ihis case
their was just nothing definite to
their sound. It was just kinda blah,
you know? Definitely a fizzler... too
bad. (Eight-One-Nine, 819 N. Second St., San Jose, CA, 95112, USA)

Zolty Cracker
Crawl and Trust Us
Cruel Elephant
Monday, Dec. 21,1992
Freak -out insanity in the King Crimson/Fred FriUVSnakefinger vein has
for many years been one of my main
interest- in music, so it is not surprising that Crawl and Trust Us is
my favorite local band. It's been a
while since I've seen a drummer
who is the lead vocalist (reminding
me a bit of Adrian Belew) and it's
also been a long time since I've seen
a guitar player with such an awesome array of home-made guitar
chords (musical chords, not ones
with quarter inch ends). Most people tend to notice guitar heroes for
their soloing, but this guy plays a lot
of weird chords real fast. Brad Lambert, who used to be the rock star
drummer in the Sarcastic Mannequins, has a setup including some
rotc-toms, a metal serving tray and
other various percussion that fails
my beer memory.
The bass player barely made it
through the set due to the in tensity of
this band, shaking his aching arms
before the last song, give him an "A"
for effort and a pair of those hand
exercisers. I hope that Mr. Bass
player doesn't take offence to my
mentioning of this as I am just trying
to describe the level of musicianship
required to play in this band.
Zolty Cracker is another cool
band wilh another unique setup: the
drummer plays a high hat with some
kind of, perhaps African or North
American, Indian drum; the singer
plays acoustic guitar and harmonizes quite well with the bass player
who has the longest fingers I've ever
seen on a girl. I think that I may have
seen her play before in an infamous,
local, all-girl punk rock band but her
"fingers only" walking style could
easily land her a job in most jazz
bands. The overall sound of this
band could be described as highly
percussive progressive folk.
You know it has been a good
night when the Evil Twang seem a
little boring in comparison to what
you've just seen. Good party music
if you haven't done any acid in the
last mon'h.

New Year's Eve
As I writs this it is New Year's Day
andmyhead hurts,it reallyhurts. On
New Year's Eve I was at a party
where I couldn't get up the nerve to
talk to tlus girl who looked like
Melissa Gilbert so I soon left to go to
the Cruel Elephant. I missed the first
three bands. I'm sure they rocked.
The place was packed. ,
Then Twerdocleb came on.
They started with a lip-sync of The
Scorpions' "StillLoving You" while
their guitars, homs and drums warbled. It ended with the big hairy ape
of a bouncerpulling the plugs out of
their amps amidst the strewn sardines, whipped cream and machine
fog. There were ten people left in the
audience. Somewhere in the middle
of their set Nardwuar came on and
REAL LIVE ACTION
sang "St. Francis in the Wood" which
caused the bandmates to have a wrestling match.
I guess Twerdocleb was sorta
like the story of "Superman red-
Superman blue." That was the one
where Superman hooked up all these
different kinds of kryptons to his
head, splitting him in two. That way
he was able to date both Lois Lane
and Lana Lang! Twerdocleb is a
powdered God-powdered Satan hybrid. It was the most amazing eight
bucks I ever spent! I got ripped off!
Did I tell you my head hurts? It
really hurts.

Mad Dogs, Seattle, WA.
New Year's Eve
Under-age and in America would
seem an unlikely combination for a
fun New Year's Eve. However, I
was given the honor of a trip to
Northgate to witness a sight that
could nearly shatter any trendy hope
of "Seattle: the musical Mecca."
After a brief voyage we arrived
in the dark backlane of Mad Dogs.
Gathering any acting abilities I had,
in case of bouncer's questioning, I
was whisked into this land of tacky
21 's and over. The dive, I mean bar,
was spacious with all the necessary
trimmings: broken chairs, a shanky
looking dog and women with big
hair. I found a dark comer to hibernate in and it was then that I became
aware of the three guys on stage
a.k.a. Balloon Man. They were hard
to miss in their keen combination of
Hawaiian prints and plaid. In fact, I
think their outfits made much more
of an impression than their music.
Then again, their cheering section of
beer-gutted buddies were pretty
funny to look at too. Apparently
they weren't bad musicians, but this
concept was far beyond my grasp.
My disappointment of ihere being
no singer quickly faded, three instruments were enough to bear.
Next up were Face on the Earth.
If you're one of those people who
fantasize about what glam rockers
look like in long underwear, this
band would be your haven of
light. One song title that sticks
(in my continuing nightmares about
this band) is "The Whisper Lady.
Did Remington fund the hair exter
sions? The singer danced on tables,
stomped around in his Doc's, banged
his head and got so out of breath I
thought (with joy) that he'd pass
out And if that wasn'tfunny enough,
they had groupies. I don't know
what Face of the Earth is supposed
to mean and, frankly, if these guys
are planning to face anything it
should be reality.
Sweet Sister Sam certainly got
the majority of the people there
sweating in their spandex. I guess
the crowd never dreamed they 'd get
to see Queensryche in a bar. The
singer had one of those opera-like
vocal ranges and looked pretty high
on himself and his keyboard-toting
band. Hey, wouldn't you be proud if
your music could induce drunk
women into believing they're exotic
dancers? This band even induced
feelings within me: to run away very
far and run very fast.
During this band's far too
lengthy set, midnight struck, a gorgeous hippie soundman kissed me
and the art of people watching became progressively closer to witnessing a deranged circus sideshow.
Finally, Tightwad appeared and
like a beacon of light shone upon a
path leading out of the pit of throbbing pain and despair I found myself
falling into. Speaking of pain, just
how the hell can a singer breathe in
a pair of women's tights? I'm too
young to want to know the answer.
In spite ofthe plethora of ridiculous
events  occurring  around  me,
Tightwad's music really stood out.
Sure, after the bands I'd seen so far
you'd think anything remotely decent could please me, but I assure
you that my opinions and cynicism
never let their guard do wn. The band
consists of five members and in spite
of some less than inspirational nicknames (Chickenhead?) they are all
very talented. Tightwad were
straight-forward, original, no bullshit
rock 'n' roll. Or, as their soundgod
puts it, "heavy groove-oriented."
Bars were open until three AM this
night so we were treated to
Tightwad's music foras long as they
could stand playing it themselves.
And I thought Christmas was over.

The Cruel Elephant kicked off
Bum's, Huevos Rancheros', and the

sold-out show. Bum opened the night
with a totally energeticperformance.
Despite going on first they drew the
biggest crowd onto the Elephant's
tiny dance floor, and out of all three
bands on that night's roster I liked
their mix of pop-punk the most.
Huevos Rancheros were up next with
their raw-edged, hi-energy, pseudo-
Shadowy Men brand of instrumental mexican "surf tunes. Normally,
instrumental bands boreme, butthey
were kinda fun. The Smugglers
would have been better if the crowd
hadn't consisted of a fat, beer-guzzling, spastic 12 year old in the body
of a 40 year old and a braless breast
flaunter. They had a nifty sing along
with Lisa from cub, and some guy
from the Hard Rock Miners. It was
a really entertaining show, and not
just because Grant's fly was undone

VARIOUS ARTISTS
Hum Buzz Thing
(Fir Street)
19 bands, wow! There's no way I'm
going to subjugate you all to my
irreverent opinion on each of 'em,
but there's always the notables:
SNFU, Dog Eat Dog, Grandma
Moses, Chris Houston's Evil Twang,
Hemp, & Dose Pump. I realize this is
all horribly subjective 'cuz one day
I'll name off another list, but thislist
just seems to represent the best of
their respective genres.

FASTBACKS
Zucher
(Sub-Pop)
More breathy garage pop-punk from
the Fastbacks!!! Zucher has a mitt
full of seamles s tunes increasing their
streak of great albums by one. Most
of the songs are the typical catchy,
noisy, instantly memorable songs
these folks are famous for. I always
thought the Fastbacks sounded like
Josie & the Pussycats would have if
they discovered punk rawk (with a
slight meddling of Phil Spector to
boot), and Zucher c
ugh songs like"Bill Challenger,"
"Kind of Game," "Hung On a Bad
Peg," or any of the other tunes on
Zucher, but don't expect to have
time to go get a sandwich between
songs, bub. Because all of the songs
comeatyouBANG.BANG.BANG,
wilh no time to even blink, and I like
that in an album.

HEAVENLY
Le Jar din de Heavenly
(K Records)
Fans of Beat Happening, Vaselines
and the Pooh Sticks will truly love
this British dish of delicacy from
above. Female-sung, sugar-sweet,
boppy pop-implosion stuff that is
sure to have even the most shy-birds
ofthe wall flower gang dancin' and
a-shakin' all over creation. The surefire "hit" of the feast will most likely
turn out to be "C is the Heavenly
Option" with backing vocals provided by "guest star" Calvin Johnson
of Beat Happening (who has, quite
possibly.themostenigmaticand recognizable voice in rock and roll today). And this star quality only adds
to the rest of the soft-touch splendor
of this heaven-like record. A fine
release by Heavenly, by God!
Grant Lawrence
KYUSS
Blues for the Red Sun
(Dall/Elektra)
Upon informing several of my
acquaintances of my task to review
this album, I was immediately
bombarded with negative opinions.
In spite of the depressing outlook ,
their words caused, my ears managed
to remain quite objective. So much
sothatlfindmyself liking thealbum.
Sure, on my first few listens I
thought it was pretty hokey, heavy,
Metallica-esque stuff, but now my
only complaint is lhat it lacks
originality. In olher words I wasn't
blown away, or calling everyone I
know telling them to buy it, or even
breathing remotely heavy. However,
with the amount of music oul there,
experiences like that rarely happen.
Some of the songs excite me even
less than day old avocado skins but
the remainder is like one big, raw,
funky, psychedelic, pulsating jam
session. When listened to in full the
tape meshes together seamlessly and
almost hypnotically, yet an
unrehearsed, live feel is still very
strong. There are several pure
instrumentals that are the most
appealing items which remind me
mainly of Tool. The singer even
grunt- through a megaphone! Whal
more could any trendy cheetah fan
hope for?

Extreme by-products.
There's a definite Japanese
flair to this, the odd thing, though, is
that the band consists of two guys
named Tetaz and Verhagen...not
quite children of the Land of the
Rising Sun. There's also East
Zudian, Hebrew and African bits
which create quite a nice sound when
blended together into this
audiotronic masterpiece.
Tracks like "Komachi Ruins,"
"Burden of Drums" and several
other vacuous titles give you the
listener a feeling of intransigence.
So just sit back and listen while
thinking about how liberation from
suffering can be gained through
enlightenment. We're all just atomic
particles and psychic, unreducible
aggregates, so let the unreality of
this sonic phenomena lead you to a
larger essence of nirvana.

BIM  SHERMAN  &  DUB
SYNDICATE
Reality
(Century 1700)
This disc represents both pleasure
and pain to the listener. Pleasure,
from the smooth haunting vocals of
Sherman paired with the driving
Dub Syndicate groove; pain, as the
listener confronts the horrendous
drum-machine dominating the last
fewcutsof/?e_/ify.
Bim Sherman, a reggae
vocalist of the soulful, latterday
Sosr -fKwvk, buy
Marvin Gaye style, is no stranger to
ON-U house-band, Dub Syndicate,
having recorded excellent material
together in the past. Together
they've been known to bring out the
best in each other, and on this
recording they also share some
memorable moments. However, all
is not as it should be. We're talking
Subtle here, with a capital s. Perhaps
it's the absence of Dub Syndicate's
main mixologist, Adrian Sherwood,
that's at the root of things, who's to
say, but with such illuminaries as
Mad Professor and Crucial Tony at
+ke -W yt* -fWisK -tkVs *MAc\  «4'U a-Iivios+ £>£  -fr*M£ -&c -fan a&+  iSSt/fT.
the controls one would expect more.
This effort lacks fire overall. Reality
sounds like a demo that, after being
unsuccessfully shopped around,
comes out on an obscure label to the
detriment of artist and consumer
alike.
You've got to be a dedicated
fan to purchase this disc. Reality is
not indicative of the capabilities and
talents of either Bim Sherman or
Dub Syndicate, and that's reality.
Too bad!!

Word Flesh Stone
(Third Mind/Road Runner)
This six song EP is the second chapter
from this Vancouver trio. Picking
up where \99l'sPearlofGreatPrice
left off, Rhys fulber, John McRae,
and Chris Peterson have put together
a powerful combination of aural
aggression that reaches deep inside
the machine to reveal a mixture of
technology, angelic cries, and
exploding vocals.
Word Flesh Stone ncludes
reworks of past material, such as an
excellent version of "Furnace of
Souls," renamed
Rekindled," and a seemingly <
produced "Father Forgive," which I
felt didn't do the original justice.
But, by far, the superior iracks on
this album are the crashing sounds
of "All Victorious" and their best
effort todate, "Souls ofThe Valiant."
This is a beat-driven instrumental
that could convert even the most
skeptical.
Don't befooled, Willisn'tjust
another techno spin-off band. This
project has a unique sound all of its
own—Word Flesh Stone is a must
for those who mingle where angels
fear to tread.
Bug Edna
RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE
(Epic/Sony)
e look at the flaming Bud
dhist monk on the cover and you
know this ain't gonna be soft. Rage
Against the Machine is one angry
band, lemme tell you! This New
York (I think) band has come up
JTa
9&  ' yS
with an album that combines metal,
jazz, a smidge of hiphop, and the
same type of uncategorizable music
that Nomeansno and others are famous for. Singer/lyricist Zach dela
Rocha pumps out the venom with
fervor as the music chugs—obviously of the Rollins school of poets/
singers—but his voice sounds more
like that of Rude Boy from Urban
Dance Squad. The music is reminiscent of Saccharine Trust (now Universal Congress Of...) more lhan
anything, and the neat effects on this
album are all created without samplers or synths, which is really cool.
The subject matter is solely concerned with anger and rebellion so
don't expect any love ballads. This
album is not something you can play
often, but when you do, it's tough
JAH CHILDREN
Inspiration Giver
(Reggaematic)
Jah Children came to town in the fall
of '92, played a few gigs, and left
numerous copies of their cassette at
some of Vancouver's specialty
record stores. For those of us who
like our reggae rootsy, with strong
vocals and harmonies, and powerful
riddims, Inspiration Giver is worth
checking out.
The unpretentiousness found
on this release is a welcome return to
basics in an idiom fragmented by
dancehall and ragamuffin styles
which have alienated many a reggae
fan in recent years. Jah Children are
not steeped in the past though. One
cut, "Reggae Rock," with its sampled
beats, is as up to dale as anything
else coming off of turntables today.
With positive, non-sexist lyrics,
singer Judah sings praise to Jah
Rastafari Selassi I ralher than rave
on about his jock size. All the while
you can't help groove to the beat of
Jah Children's forthright
musicianship.
If this release has a fault it
would have to be its brevity. This
howc
is of all 5
'"V
Giver includes du
titles, clocking in at just over 40
minutes. Give this one a listen.

Davis' most important bands; it was an artistic
and critical triumph and a commercial failure...

and his nonet with such luminaries as Max
Feb. 15: One of the most phenomenal
dn-nmers in Jazz was Buddy Rich (he wouldtel
you that himseft-.hewasalsoagredbandeader
who was able to transfer his exiting drum concept to a big band. One ol he best albums was
"Mercy Mercy" recorded ive _ Ceasa/s Palace
in Los Vegas., donl miss this one.
Feb. 22: "Kely at Midnight" is our fealure
tonight... Wynton Kely was as fine a piano
player as you could imagine... he could play
almost anything and worked with almost every
important modem Jazz figure: most importantly Miles Davis. He was so good and so
consistent that he was taken for granted and
never got the recognition he deserved (he ded
in Toronto in 1971). Here's Wynton with Paul
Chambers (bass) and "Philly Joe" Jones
(drums) at his peak.

ew releases from }    p and why you should own them
Bettie Serveet
®   Palomine
The great thing about this record is what it
doesn't try to be. It doesn't try to be the
loudest the wierdest the fastest, or the
hippest indie rock record on the planet
Palomine is all about great songs and
tasteful playing. This in itself makes it
extraordinary in the world of post-Nirvana
meltdown. (Plus the lead singer Carol grew
up here in Vancouver.)
Come
®   Eleven: Eleven
Although the appeal of this album is
immediate, its overall effect is lasting.
This is blues for the nineties. Try to
imagine the riffage of vintage Rolling
Stones, with the rhythmic sensibilities of
Fugazi  or  Helmet,  topped  off with
expressive vocals a la Patti Smith, or
Broken English-era Marianne Faithful.
Soul music for an angry generation.
Thinking Fellers Union Local 282
® The Mother Of All Saints
Although compared to early Sonic Youth
and Butthole Surfers in their experimental
approach to rock music. TFUL282 are quite
different in the sense that they refused to
settle into one. dare we say it. "generic"
sound. This album contains such a variety
of sounds, textures, and rhythms that it will
always challenge (if you're willing to let it).
Pavement
® Watery. Domestic
Sometimes it seems that all the cool things
about Pavement have already been written.
The title of this EP refers to American beer
and there is a song about Linden, Alberta on
it so forget the Velvet Underground, "Waiting
For The Man" comparisons — this is the
essence of Pavement Four songs of
slacker-beat at it's finest
AND YET MORE COOL STUFF:
Cell
®  Slo-Blo
This is the band that has been heavily hyped by the NME and Melody Maker as the future of rock'n'roll
They are Thurston Moore's latest signing to his Ecstatic Peace label. It's going to be at least three months
until the next Buffalo Tom record, so if you have a hankering for some action...
Shonen Knife
®   Let's Knife
Sometimes it seems everything really sucks in February, it's cold and gray, the Canucks go into their
traditional mild season slump, no good shows. Well to use a time-worn cliche, this is the album to shake
you out of your depression. From Japan with love, pop songs filled with innocence, joy. and capital-f fun.
Intermix
®  PhazeTwo
This is yet another side project from the prolific minds of Frontline Assembly's Bill Leeb & Rhys Fulber. Like last
year's self-titled release, this is more dance-oriented than the ambience of Delerium or the agro of FLA. No matter
which side of the electronic music spectrum you're on, any release from these guys is worth lending an ear to.
Stereo MCs
®  Connected
This is the third release from the Stereo MCs. a follow up to the recent Supernatural album, and one of
the most popular albums on UK import from the last couple of months because of heavy club play from
the singles "Step ft Up" and "Connected". The album is now finally available in North America. Snap it up!

® Magnum Opiate
Magnum Opiate is the debut full-length CD on
Zulu Records from Vancouver's Lung. Clear the
wax out of your ears and listen to these comments: |
"Pretty amazing shit here... great in a
demented way." maximum rock'n'roll
'They like to wreck stuff." snipehunt
"Lung are a seething vat of guitar meltdown, severe enough that bands like
Helmet and Sonic Youth should develop a dandy crick in their neck from
looking over their shoulders." Vancouver sun
