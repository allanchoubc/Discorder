ii  Vancouver
Special
Recorded live, this eight-song EP
can't hope to compete with the
high-quality production values of
the Brundlefly and Star
Collector CDs. Still, there's
lething about the end r
that  :
STAR COLLECTOR
Demo Model 256
(Independent)
Star Collector is named after
a Monkees song (which I've
had in my head ever since picking up this CD), and in a way
that makes sense. Early
Monkees songs were carefully
crafted (by crack professional
songwriters), flawlessly played
(by studio musicians), and perfectly calculated to be million-
sellers. Demo Model 256 has
that same kind of slick, almost
"greatest hits" feeling to i
*   the
course of its 12 songs, which is
kind of weird since this is Star
Collector's debut CD. Of
course in most ways there's no
link to the hapless Monkees:
this band writes and plays its
own songs here, and the
colour-photocopied fold-out
cover includes adequate visual
; us of the Star
Collector's hip, post-modern
vision of popular music. Is this
perfectly huge mid-to-late
'60s/early '70s boy power-pop
tion, based on the best elements of recent compilations
such as Poptopia! and The
Roots of Power Pop, designed
to mock the listening public's
seemingly insatiable hunger for
Cheap Trick, Badfinger,
and even Trooper-style catchy
arena rock? Well, some might
say so. Some might also say
that the guitar solos tend to be
needlessly long, but I don't
care. The big ringing chords,
mod-ish riffs, and happy boy-
harmonies make me smile, and
every one of these hooks succeeds in reeling me in. A smattering of the strongest tracks:
"Skyscraper," "Turn You On,"
and my own favourite, "Motorcycle."

BRUNDLEFLY
Locked in This House
(Lotusland)
Ian Somers, who sings and
writes the songs for Brundlefly,
has a likeable, anguished, gravelly voice, and most of these 14
songs are bleak, pained creations with thoughtful post-
Seattle-sound arrangements
Catchy as many of these songs
are musically, the darkness of the
lyrics and that voice makes for a
CD to be listened to with care —
recently heartbroken friends just
might make off with it if they get
the chance. Even "New Girl,"
with its very singalongable and
uncharacteristically happy chorus, is grim and creepy in the
verses — which, of course, is
part   of    Brundlefly's    spooky

LAVISH
Demo EP
(Independent)
rell-si
>   tfie
mostly slow, gloomy arrangements and snarly, sneering,
nasal female vocals of this band
Contrary to their name, Lavish
is quite spare-sounding, with
very little keyboard in evidence
but several ominous bass
and guitar-driven Barbara
Manning ish moments. The
singer sometimes slides into a
kind of snotty/pained near-
yodel, which is especially effective in "Our Son," the oddly
satisfying, Valium-paced Eddie
Money cover, "Two Tickets to
Paradise," and the rocking, obvious single here, "Happy/Sad."
Sometimes the best lyrics are
indeed the most straightforward
— how can you beat "I am
happy/You are sad" for saying
it all? (address unknown)
I am the mother of all cows. I'm
kind of fat and I have bad
skin.  Oh, and I'm really mean
and I know it so the following
bands don't have to tell me.
Technically, there's nothing
wrong with JOYELLE
BRANDT. She can almost sing
in tune and she plucks her
acoustic guitar accordingly, but
there's just something wrong with
someone who proclaims that she
sounds like Sarah McLachlan
Brandt's songs are not uncomfortable, I wouldn't even go so
far as saying that they're bad,
but they're just not good. She
might even be famous someday.
People seem to love wishy-washy
females with guitars.
(<rowan@intergate.bc.ca>)
I remember talking to someone about ISIS SPEAKS She
seemed very nice, but unfortunately, this band is not They
sound like spacey jazz for kids
In "Cruise Blues" a woman sings
nonsensical sounds while someone else snaps their fingers in
the background. "Diamonds are
Forever" features lyrics about
slavery and nuclear war with the
added dimension of the sounds
of whips cracking, (address
unknown)
The YACHTSMEN hail from
Victoria. They have that Beach
Boyish charm that some people
like, but the B-side of their demo
tape has a bunch of crap by
somebody named DJ N-oying.
Whoever it is samples Nine
Inch Nails' "Closer " At least
they chose the perfect name.
Annoying is right. (4335
Blenkinsop Rd., Victoria, BC)
:alled
I'm not sure what this band
is called. They used to be called
Fridge Art Tiara, if I'm not
mistaken, and on this tape
they're called BOY VS. GIRL,
ne that they're
Nevertheless, they are a boy
and a girl, playing mostly
acoustic guitar. The girl sings
better than the boy, but together
they sound kind of nice. I'm not
sure what's going on with all of
the backwards record samples.
(<henville@direct.ca>)
When I say something is
good, my judgement may be distorted because I've spent hours
listening to things that are really
bad, but when I heard HOT
HOT HEAT's demo, I felt like
dancing. They've got a synthesizer/drum based sound, and
the vocals are composed of two
guys yelling. I listened to this
tape more than once because I
wanted to. I want to see them
live; hell, I'd even buy their CD if
they had one. (#7-4275

while since I've turned lo the
turntable — when you work
around music as much as I do,
you often don'l have it in you to

Any of you readers seen that
Detroit Rock City movie? I sav< a
few trailers, and it looks like a
goofy tale about some young
longhairs out to rock it up with
KISS The soundtrack to this
movie is rocktastic. Lookoutl has
put out a split 7" featuring the
DONNAS and Kiss on clear
vinyl, and I'm sure all of you
rockers are going to need to
have this The Donnas do a
cover of Kiss's "Strutter" in their
usual super-sultry-voiced style,
with some extra fantastical wailing guitar solos to boot. I have
never quite gotten this whole
Donnas craze which seems to
have swept the nation, but after
hearing "Strutter," it all makes a
little more sense Also new to the
world of Kiss, I was surprised at
how much I enjoyed their song,
"Detroit Rock City " I now intend
to go out and purchase all of the
Kiss Psycho Circus comic books
and action figures. Um, no

BY JULIE COLERC
stand: Why is it that, if you are a
garage-rock band, you will probably have the opportunity to put
out skads of releases when
you're, well, not very good? The
LOUDMOUTHS are the fuel for
my latest ponderance of this
question They get to put out
releases with excellent packaging (the "Gone Drinkin'" release
from '96 has a great cut-out doll
design) on coloured vinyl, but
the music just isn't that hot I'm
sure they have a lot of fans in
their home town. Now, I want
to make it clear that there are
good garage-rockers out there,
and I don't really know heads'
from tails, but this band is boring They got their gimmick and
ran with it, maybe a bit too far
The songs sound the same from
one release to the next, and it's
all just a big screaming mess. I
hope these guys live far away,
so they don't come and beat me
up. They look tough I'm not
tough enough to take the
Loudmouths on, but I'm sure
some of you are These three 7"s
are all on different labels, so
Irack some of them down if
you're into girls in leopard print
tanks with bangs and ripped
fishnets screaming mod fight
songs and "babyl", and boys in
Converse holding it all together

On to something a bit quieter, and quite a bit better.
Here's music to do homework to:
PAUL        NEWMAN       and
SONNA, two instrumental
bands, take turns doing the
same song, "Way to Breathe No
Breath," each band giving it a
new flavour. The Paul Newman
track has a bit of electronic percussion, and moves along at a
pleasant pace. It's got good repetition and sweet sounds. I didn't  find   this  track   nearly  as
"lonely" as the press material
told me I should Maybe I'm just
not alienated enough Maybe if I
read some of them Acme comics
and then give this another
whirl... Oh, so sad The Sonna
track is a good deal more sparse
than the Paul Newman, but also
sounds really, really good. I didn't even realise, after the first listen, that this was the same song
done differently. That's a good
sign. More diversity tends to
lead to more goodness, in my
books. I like Is quiet and charming. Nice speed, nice feel, nice
packaging — it all works (The
Temporary Residence Limited,
PO Box 22910, Baltimore, MD,
21203 USA)
Anyone out there sad that
BRAID broke up? I remember
enjoying their full-length last summer, and the singles they've put
out since then have been pretty
decent. These guys are pop-
punk-emoooo, and they do it
well enough to not make me
vomit This new single, "Please
Drive Faster", is making me reminisce of trips to Seylynn Hall
and cute little punk rock boys
Ah, how sad that I'm the eternal
morpher, and can probably
never go back. So I'm taking
back my strongly pronounced
dislike of all things emo as I realize that Braid are kinda neat.
The kids like them. I don't mind
them. Does this mean the kids
will like me? Nah I could draw
those x's on my hand like Bif
Naked s got. She must be
straightedge hardcore. No bother in politicizing this — fun is fun
and Braid is fun and Braid is
done so tough nuts! Buy this and
weep. (Polyvinyl Record Co, PO
Box 1885, Danville, IL, 61834
USA)
One more single to try out,
and this one's an epic — but
should I really expect much less
from Michael Giro's new project, the ANGELS OF LIGHT?
This ex-Swans star is capable
of many magical things when
given a multitude of instruments
and a little room to explore
sound. I have never listened to
much Swans, but Giro's recent
project The Body Lovers was
quite interesting, and the full-
length that this single comes from
is excellent. The songs on this
single, "Praise You" and "God
Servant," are both stellar, but
maybe I'm just a sucker for
strings, full sounds, and a deep
and doomy voice. The lyrics are
quite dark, but they work like a
charm. I think this single is probably considerably more accessible than most Swans or Body
Lovers work, so it could be a
good record to try if you're at all
curious about the music of
Michael    Giro. (Stripmine

My year is ruined. I was
not invited to the 1999
Vancouver International
Film Festival Opening Gala.
Rubbing salt into my socially
inept wounds, this Opening
gala, the first one
festive
s that I
vited tc
will be the last Opening Gala of
the millennium! I don't know if
this grievous oversight on the
part of the official festival inviters
was a result of drastic budget
cutbacks (in which independent
music/lifestyles magazines catering to the needs of free-thinkers
in Vancouver were deemed
undeserving of VIFF graft) or my
free-thinking, independently
toasted boozing at previous
Opening Galas. Maybe my mail
carrier is going in my place.
Whatever the reason for my
enforced absence from the only
Vodka-sponsored event on my
one-event social calendar, I will
now be forced to spend the night
before the festival sitting alone in
my apartment, drinking crantinis
and holding imaginary conver
sations with Vancouver's film
community elite. Really, the only
difference will be locale — and
the fact that this year I'll be
naked.
Shaking myself out of this B-
list malaise, and without further
whimpering, I will for your planning pleasure attempt to strip
bare this
yea
s festiv
logue. Viewed al fresco, there
are some noticeable changes to
this year's line up. Replacing the
standard, and much loved,
Hong Kong action flicks enjoyed
in festivals past [Beast Cop [VIFF
98], Once Upon a Time in Triad
Society [VIFF 97], Fong Sai Yuk
[VIFF 93]) are a collection of
Japanese horror films guaranteed to chill your bones just in
time for fall. Taking the X-Files
vibe world-wide, Japanese cinema will hopefully bring all of its
atmospheric, contemplative
charms to such spookfests as
Ring and Ring 2, Iwo could-be-
Cronenburgian tales of evil
videotapes, murder and insanity
told   in   the   race-against-time
investigation style of DOA.
Audition is a spin on the dark
side of the entertainment industry with director Miike Takashi at
the wheel. It's described in the
festival guide as "an extremist
psycho-thriller featuring scarred
thighs, home addresses which
turn out to have been boarded
up for years, drugged whisky,
acupuncture needles, piano wire
and some quite terrifying time
slips...it's calculated to make you
think twice about everything
from ballet lessons to paranoid
nightmares." Just what the evil
doctor ordered on a wet,
windswept Vancouver night
If the Japanese horror series
seems a little too. normal to
you, there's always the Walk
on the Wild Side series
Another change in the standard
VIFF MO, this weekend midnight
series, traditionally the home of
films that the other movies are
afraid of, will not be at the
sparkle-curtained Caprice theatre on Granville St. in 1999.
Instead, the rock-hard seats at
matheque have
estling butts foi
the Pacific C
the honour c
the festival's
tures. The hands-down (in the
popcorn, nervously grasping at
the kernels) most exciting happening   in   the   witching-hour
I  this
year
s  tfie
at Gastown's indie addition to
the Vancouver filmic scene. Each
evening's events will include an
8pm showing followed by a
party at which festival guests
(read: directors, stars, fabulous
people) will illuminate wine-swilling patrons about the fine fea-.
ture just experienced. Seating is
limited to 100 swillers and the
roster of films looks discussion-
Vamp
program
Besides the UK
treats, an ambitious
of visual challenges
awaits, including Tekhne, a
"discussion on the merits
applications of technology
in the arts" and Spectre
the Spectrum, "an altern
nd
of
history to our century, in which
the evil empires of technological
masters are excoriated and
ridiculed, and the technological
dream of the 'information age'
is flipped over like a damp
rock."
On October 1 Oth, when the
festival lights dim for another
year, I'll be slipping back under
my damp rock. Luckily, it's

really, because even though you

art, computers, words and even
panels in a style that is unique.
It's so damn artsy that his name

swipes at pop culture and non-

tiny bodied, big headed girls
Sheri and Kathy — who could
be contenders for the Sanrio

sadistic. The other artist is
David Choe. His story, "Slow

so aimless and perfect. It's real.

favourite is David

Tolerable twee pop? Yes, it is possible Just ask
any fan (and there are lots of themj of dearly-
departed bands Talulah Gosh and Heavenly
Boy, could those people put together a good song
or what? Returning to tour North America after 7
years, the newest incarnation of all things pop and
good stopped off in Seattle for an all-ages gig. I
was scared as all get-out when I got the
opportunity to speak to Amelia Fletcher, former
member of both the above-mentioned bands, and
now responsible for the equally good, if slightly
more "mature" project known as Marine Research.
Calvin still loves them, and so do I. So cute So
pop. So smart. Just take a look.
DiSCORDER: For those not in the know,
names and instruments, please.
Cathy: I'm Cathy and I play keyboards
Amelia:   I'm   Amelia   and   I   sing   and   play
You were speaking before the tape was
rolling about dedicated fans. I know a lot
of people who are quite obsessed with
previous incarnations of Marine
Research. How has it been over here?
Amelia: We were iervous that Heavenly fans
would be a little bewildered by — or unsure of —
Marine Research. [We expected them to] shout out
for Heavenly stuff. We thought that when they
heard that we were a bit different, they'd be
disappointed Actually, everyone's been really
good, and has seemed really excited.
Cathy: We were quite surprised, because we
haven't been here for a long time. It's been a while
since the last Heavenly record came out, and we
weren't quite sure whether people remembered,
or even still cared. When we came here, we
thought that we'd have to convince new people
It's been a mixture of dedicated older fans and
some new fans The thing about being on K
Records is that it means something here in a way
that it doesn't, so much, in England. People who
might not have liked us when we were on Sarah
might like us [now].
You're touring before the release of your
record. Do people know what's going on?
Amelia: We weren't meant to We were meant to
get the record out first, but we managed to not get
it finished in time, and it was too late to change
the tour. We had all booked time off of work and
we wanted to time it with YoYo. I was very nervous
that our audiences would be extremely small; I
talked to the people at K about it, and they all
assured me that it would be fine. They sent CDs
out to radio stations and journalists, so, actually,
there have been tons of people at all the shows.
Cathy: Most people haven't had the opportunity
ia: Some people have heard various things
on the radio, and people have heard 'Queen B',
which was our first single
Why did you choose to include the
.'Queen B' single on the full-length
record?
Amelia: It was quite a limited pressing, and it
sold out Rather than keep a 7" in print when lots
of people can't even play vinyl these days, it
seemed more sensible to take it out of print and
put it on the CD.
Is there any special story behind the label
you released that single on in the UK?
Amelia: Where It's At Is Where You Are...
Cathy:      is going to take over the world! That's
the story
That's a line from a Huggy Bear song.
Amelia: It is He's just a real fan, he's really cool.
It was really nice doing something on his label. It
came at a time when we weren't too sure of
I was quite nice to have someone
saying, 'You're brilliant!' At the time, no one else
was saying that to us, so it was good.
Cathy: It's like how people go to halfway houses
where they get lots of encouragement so that they
can be let out into the real world.
Amelia: He was like our psychotherapist.
[laughs]
Were you recording things before this
single came about? How long had you
been back together?
Amelia: We actually were together and
practicing for quite a while before we recorded
that single, six months at least.
How did this regeneration come about?
In the K bio, it says that DJ, your
drummer, convinced you all to play, but
then I'd heard elsewhere that you all
were playing on your own.
Cathy: All of us except for Amelia were doing
other bands. Basically, what happened was that
the four of us who were in Heavenly all realized,
at different points, that we quite missed it [There
was] a definite period after Matthew died when
we didn't want to dp anything, but then I think
everyone was probably sitting at home thinking,
'Yeah, it was kinda fun.' Amelia's story was that
Rob and I took her out for lunch and convinced
her to do it again, but I don't recall that at all.
Amelia: It's totally true!
Cathy: Amelia and Rob were both starting, but it
was fairly slow progress. I thought that because
Where's It's At Is Where You Are is such an indie
label and comes out of the scene that Heavenly
was a part of, that this person [DJ] who was doing
dance music on the label was bound to have that
same indie background. It turned out that I was
right, he was an old Heavenly fan. He came along
to the first practice, as a programmer, and he sat
in the corner.  He said,  'How am I meant to
practice as a programmer?' and sat in the corner
iooking really glum with his head in his lap; at the
end of the practice, he said, 'I don't think you
really need a programmer, I think you need a
drummer.' We thought he was trying to get out of
it, but then he said that [he used to drum], and so
we said okay.
The word being used to describe your
new record is 'mature.'
Cathy: We are older.
But do you think that that automatically
reflects on a record?
Amelia: When we first started, one of the things
I felt I would never really be able to do, just
because I hadn't done it in such a long time, was
jump up and down on stage in a punk rock,
immature way. The first couple of gigs I was very
still, but now I'm so used to doing it again that I
could pogo with the best of them. Because we did
have a gap, it did feel funny coming back.
Heavenly somehow remained very youthful
sounding, even though we were growing older;
because we never really had a break, we never
had a chance to review that. Having had a break,
it just seemed really natural to come back
sounding mature, certainly mellower.
Cathy: I think the last Heavenly album did sound
slightly more mature than the one before it, but I
think this is more than that same difference. It's
something to do with what sounds you have that
makes it feel mature. It's thicker and denser now,
a bit like a peach when it gets squidgy and ripe,
more than when it's perky and still has yellow skin.
Amelia: You mean we're squidgy now?
Cathy: I think we are kind of squidgy! To use a
word that Amelia uses and Pete really hates, it
'sits'; it's not like a barking spaniel. It's more
dignified. If you took the average beats per minute
of this record, I'm sure they're lower than the last
Also in the K press material there were
articles from the British press. It seems
that  with  the   new  band  comes  new
interest.    Was    there    an    interest    in
Heavenly?
Cathy: There was a very negative interest.
One    piece    compared    you    to    the
Cardigans.
Amelia: I don't really understand that.
Cathy: I think that's another way that being on K
makes a difference. Sarah was always an uncool
label; virtually every Sarah band got slagged off
in the press at home.
Amelia: It was only a critical thing. Lots of people
loved Sarah. Critics didn't like Sarah, I don't know
Cathy: Because they weren't cool. They didn't get
pissed and take drugs and pick up girls and do
the sorts of things that music...
a: They refused to play by the rules. The
result of that was that their bands sold less records
than they might have done, but fair enough. I
respected them for it.
I had heard how horrible the UK press is.
Cathy: It is pretty vicious
Amelia: It's quite up its own ass, really. Even
now, with Marine Research, we've got so many
journalists that love us and want to write about our
stuff, but unless you get the editors, who are
basically in their own little world and only know
about the biggest band, to agree to let someone
do a feature, you're stuck. In Melody Maker, we
have journalists arguing for us, but we're probably
not going to get a piece because the editors aren't
into it, and we're not Suede.
Cathy: It's not just music journalism at home. I
think that the standards of journalism are pretty
darn shoddy. It is amazing coming here, not just
seeing music papers, but how all papers are better
researched and more objective, rather than some
emotive analysis of something, which is what
everything is like at home.
K is probably a better label to get your
stuff out on. I've never seen your first
album. Heavenly vs. Satan.
Amelia: We are going to re-release that at some
point, it's just that I've been rather feckless about
organizing that. At some point those songs will be
available
Cathy: Don't say that! It's subject for a hot legal
dispute in the high court at the moment. As scon
as that's resolved, it will come out.
Amelia: Yes, our lawyers ...
Cathy: We've blown billions.
I read in an Avocado Baby interview that
they considered Talulah Gosh 'punk
rock.' Are you punk rock? Is that what
your ethics are about?
Amelia: It's interesting, there's ethics and then
there's aesthetics. I think our ethics are very punk
rock, we're very DIY, we do practically everything
for ourselves, apart from what K does for us.
Everything that Fugazi stands for is also what we
stand for, ethically. Aesthetically, we're absolutely
nothing like that! We're not really into making the
loudest noise we possibly can or creating a stir,
or even lyrically, writing things that are going to
change the world. Lyrically, we're even more
introverted than we ever were. Our lyrics are
really quite internal now.
That's something I noticed. Heavenly's
P.U.N.K. Girl single was quite ...
Amelia: Political.
You were/weren't involved in the riot
grrrl scene?

how it was.

were really ethically involved. I set up gigs for
Bratmobile and Bikini Kill in England, and Huggy

Amelia: Most venues are pretty relaxed, nothing
like here. When I was booking this tour, I forgot
about the issue. A lot of the gigs we've been
playing have been 18+ and 21+, and I've felt
really guilty about that. Some of the places we've
been doing in-stores as well, to try to get those who
are younger to come along and see us for free

DJ: We've actually ended up on bills with some of
the most noisy, abrasive bands, particularly those
American    bands.    Aggressive,    gritty   bands.
Cathy: We played a gig with Fugazi in England.
They, nicely, wanted us to. English people were
like, 'Oh, they're playing with Fugazi.' It lends a
sort of credibility. Music journalists, on their own,
would never think that we could have the slightest
connection to Fugazi.
Do you have any preference to what
types of shows you play?
Amelia: Foolishly, on this tour, I didn't really think
about it. In England, although there all laws about
licensed venues, it's so flexible. I've been going to
gigs since I was 14. My brother used to go and
see the Damned and the Clash when he was, like,

Amelia: We were saying that it's one of the better
things about touring when you're a little older. Your
friends tend to be a little older as well, which
means they've got nicer houses. When Heavenly
first came to Olympia, we stayed with Candace as
well, and at that point she had a tiny one-room flat
that was really quite rank. It was alright for one
person, but it was really bad for seven! This time,
she's got a nice house. There's the plus-side of
maturity. The minus-side is that if we had've stayed
in any rank places, we wouldn't have stood it.

Island Records "We're realistic, we know how it works," says James
of the major labels "The independent scene is obviously completely
different and much more exciting." Which is not to say that it also
does not have its downfalls, says Broon "There are a lot of people
who don't get paid Because you are small, you don't have any
control and people exploit you   But most of the people are really
The British independent scene also has its own politics,
including the "British DJ Mafia," a term coined by Mixmaster Morris
which describes the powerful hold a handful of select, popular
progressive-trance DJs have on the clubs:
Broon They definitely control a lot of the British music scene. We
have very few gigs in Britain; we get a lot of gigs in continental
Europe There are big names in Britain, and they are pretty boring,
really It's pop music now
James It's good, it's positive, because it means you have a healthy
underground — and that's always where it is interesting anyway. We
tried to run over Paul Oakenfold, actually In the same day we were
driving around London, we saw one of the Chemical Brothers ond we
tried to hit him   We were doing a service
We all take a good laugh as James, tongue-in-cheek, goes
on about hitting the "Garth-looking" Chemical Brother. More beers
are ordered
Joking aside, James and Broon are serious about their
music Diverse artists such as Ministry, Mr Fingers, Kraftwerk, Human
League, Public Enemy, and DJ Premier are some of their influences It
was Maurizio and the Basic Channel sound, however, that really
caught their ears "Especially on Snowboarding in Argentina," says
James. "We had M4 [a Maurizio release]," adds Broon, "and we
just went 'wow' " "Jesus Christ ... this is like, dub music," interrupts
James. Broon continues on: "Up to that point, we had been making

The
experienced Swayzak was this past July when they
came to Sonar on a North American tour Performing
a very live electronic set (not something all that easy to
do), they proceeded to play thumping tech-house that
kept the sweaty Sonar crowd going well past 2 AM.
Before the performance, I had the chance to catch up
with James  and  Broon,  the  semi-shy  minds  behind
Swayzak.
James and Broon have known each other for ten
years, and started making music about six years ago. Broon
hails from Glasgow, Scotland and James from somewhere
unidentified in Britain. Before music became their lives, they
both worked as A&R and Promotional reps at then U2-owned
shad
Many would take the chance to criticise Swayzak for not
expanding their sounds through different machines and for being
heavily sample-based. But when you consider what they have
done with so little, you realise the brilliance behind, and
between, the sparse beats "There dre a few secret weapons
as well that we can't divulge," adds James   "We've got a
few analogue synths, but we've got to sample them
anyways," says Broon. "For the new album, we've got
another sampler, and a drum machine, and a few more
toys. There is a bit more depth to the new one. It will
seem more full than the first. The fir-
worked on it on a part-time basis. Bu
on it." Broon pauses to take a sip of something dark,
and James continues on: "The first album is like a
collection of tracks. We put them out on our own
label, and then we put them together to put out the
album. This one we started with nothing — we had
to come up with 10 songs that would work as an
album. We have many different influences, and we
do different styles all the time. We were worried it
would be really disparate and all over the place,
but now it's fine, it's finished."
James and  Broon go on  to  reveal  the
origins of the debut LP: "The first
cident,'
,ays
hop music really, then we started making real deep stuff, just from
listening to [M4] " Talking and finishing each other's sentences, the
British/Scottish mixed accents are as fluid as their music. I asked
them whether or not, in light of their recent publicity, they considered
themselves a part of the "underground":
James Don't know We have a small label, we put out a thousand
1 2"s, we play a lot of clubs wilh sometimes no people, we don't get
Broon: But at the same time, we're crossover. There are a lot of
people getting access to our music. We're not totally underground,
yet we're not mainstream.
James: We're not exclusive. We made a video and got it shown on
MTV. The thing is to get the music heard — I think obviously the
further you go up the ladder, the more difficult it gets.
Broon: People like Terry Francis [British deep-house producer], you
know, they've been underground for 10 years, and now he's making
a big name for himself. He'll be a part of the mainstream British DJ-
culture soon. And he's playing the music that we play.

One thing I had to ask about was the

you just stay inside. It is nice to escape into warm noises. Some of it
is quite happy, and some of it is quite sad, often in the same song.
Depending on how you feel, it can set off different emotions.
We all take another swig of our drinks. Broon looks up
shyly, and reveals a bit about how they go about production:
"Basically a bit like what Basic Channel and the Chain Reaction guys
— you've got very little equipment, and that's why the music's
minimal You don't have any money, and that makes the music like
that. We've got one sampler, an old guitar, and Cubase, and that was it."
" ^^        "" "Everything's       been       an
accident," adds James, "we finally
got around to putting out a 1 2" single after about
3 years of working together. We did not know
what or where our music would fit in. And we
went around to all the shops, to see who would
stock it. Discovered that most of the shops weren't
stocking it. But there were a couple of good
underground shops that just sold shitloads of it,
and we're like 'wow, that's amazing.'"
They then ran into an old friend from
Island Records, who was running his own label in
New York. Two days after hearing a copy of the
12", he called them up and said, "let's do an
album." Swayzak said all right, and the rest is now
tech-house history.
The new album is more on the Detroit
techno tip, say the two. "We came back from the
Winter Music Conference after hearing a bunch of
electro, and came home and did two tracks in a
week that were like 430 West, Octave One  And we
were like 'ooooh,'" says James. Expect elements of
Detroit, some straight up vocal house, some very
Rhythm and Sound influenced material, and some
collaborations with Benjamin Zephaniah, a British dub-
poet and ex-burglar who has been nominated for Poet
Laureate. With a track record of innovative and intelligent
music, house and technoheads should watch for the new
Swayzak album, which hits stores in early 2000. • Luke Meat met wifh legendary

DiSCORDER: Could I just clarify some
rumours that have hovered over the
band?
Robert Pollard: Okay
Rumour: Bob Pollard has written over
2500 songs.
That's probably correct; I mean, I don't count 'em,
but somewhere around that number. I have a big
suitcase full of tapes of songs, and we recently went
through them and tried to put 'em on CDs. Well,
we went through maybe one eighth of the box and
that was 150 songs right there.
Rumour: Bob Pollard knows the titles to
all of them.
[The band nods in agreement]
Well no, not all of them, but I can remember titles
pretty well.
Rumour: All of these songs are about your
ex-girlfriend.
Well, my wife was my first girlfriend, so I don't
have any ex-girlfriends.
Rumour: Guided By Voices never sacrifices
hummability to practice art for art's sake.
Definitely. It's always about the songs whether or
not they're catchy. And you can tell Wayne Coyne
[of the Flaming Lips] that!
So you're not a fan?
It has nothing to do with being a fan, I simply don't
own four CD players to listen to that album
[Zaireeka].
Actually, a friend of mine mixed them all
together on a four-track so you could hear
it all on one tape at once and the songs
aren't really that interesting.
Well there you go!
Rumour: The band has 12 cases of beer
backstage at every show.
We're pushing 12, we push 12 ... they keep 'em
coming!
Craig Marks from SPIN envisioned you
'hunkered down before a gig, engaged in
a game of RISK or recounting last week's
episode of The X-Files.' Is that an adequate analogy?
Not at all, not at all. It's funny because at one time
SPIN magazine were very good to us.
In that case, did you get Jim Greer to kick
his ass for spreading such slander?
Ha ha. Jim was a member of GBV but no, nothing
like that.

By Lilice Meat
You live in Dayton, Ohio, where my hero,
Les Nessman [of WKRP fame] is from.
You mean the actor or the character?
The character. Now, is there such thing as
the Buckeye Newshawk Award [award
won by Nessman's character 5 f/'mes]?
The what?
Is there any award given to Ohio radio
personalities for doing superior hog and
agriculture reporting for the Tri-City area?
Well ... I really don't know what you mean.
Were  you   living   in  Ohio  when  Jerry
Springer was Mayor of Cincinnati?
Well, yes, he was mayor of Cincinnati.
Was he a good mayor?
Uh, I didn't really pay attention at that time.
Oh, okay. The NHL is introducing the
Columbus  Bluejackets this year.  Now,
Ohio has never had a professional hockey
team before ...
That's not correct.
Oh. I'm sorry. The Cleveland Barons [sic],
that's right. However, do you feel that
more hockey will: a) raise morale, b)
lower morale, or c) do nothing?
I'm afraid it will probably do nothing. Americans
are too interested in their football and baseball to
get excited about hockey.
What's the best thing about Dayton?
The pizza. We definitely have the best pizza in the
world ...and beer.
What's the beer of choice?
Bud
Johnathan Valania recently did an article
on the band in Magnet...
Is that out yet?
I don't know; I just read about the article
on the Internet, which mentions 'the Kim
[Deal] and Bob feud.' Would you care to
comment on that?
Now, now It's interesting that you use the word
'feud', since it takes two people to be in a feud,
and I have nothing against Kim. She simply is no
longer on speaking terms with us. It's more of a Kim
Deal/Dayton, Ohio feud.
Okay. If the Who played at this year's
Woodstock, do you think the crowd's
response would be: a) better than 30
years ago, b) worse than 30 years ago,
or c) no response at all?
Pete Townsend said that the first Woodstock was
really bad for them, right?
I thought they were greatl
So did I. Uh, I don't think they would've been any
better than when I saw them four years ago on the
Quadrophenia tour. It was pretty bad. Pete plays his
guitar up here now [indicating high up on his neck].
'College radio' is now a moniker like
'alternative' or 'punk'. Do you feel that
college radio still has an important place
in '90s rock and roll?
Definitely. Definitely. I mean, those were the only
stations that played us in the beginning.
Going from Cleveland's Scat Records to
Matador, and now releasing Do the
Collapse on TVT Records — what influenced the change from Matador to TVT?
We wanted to be distributed by Capitol, but the
deal between Matador and Capitol fell through,
and TVT were very anxious to do an album with us.
With your high kicks and microphone
twirling, do you ever hit anyone in the
head?
All the time. All the time.
What was your weirdest gig ever?
New York, about three weeks ago. I fell down three
Four     years     ago     you     played     the
Commodore, in Vancouver, BC ...
[interrupting] What's the Commodore?
It's a really, really big room.
Was that for some music festival?
Yes, Music West '96.
That was a great, great show!
I agree. For the encore, though, you just
simply took requests.   Can you do that
with the new band?
We don't do requests anymore, but the new band
and I have gone over about 75-100 old songs and
we're adding more each night. Nothing against
the old band, but the new band allows me to work
with more freedom than before.
You recently played a show
Youth, the day they lost their
their equipment. Any word or
No. They found the Ryder truck a c
ago,
but it
/ith Sonic
in with all
heir stuff?
pie of days
mpty.
Oh, I 'was going to check your equipment
to see if you had any weirdly-tuned
Jazzmasters.
No, but we loaned them our gear the day after they
had their stuff stolen, and all our guitars came back
in really weird tunings! [laughter]
Who's the weirdest celebrity fan of Guided
by Voices?
Peter Wolf — I don't know if that's weird — David
Crosby, Phyllis Dillei.
Are you serious?
No. Cameron Diaz had Waved Out in her CD
player apparently.  Jim Greer told me that.
With songwriting, when you collaborate
with someone, does that make it a GBV
song, and when you write it alone, does it
go on the next solo album?
It depends on what record it's going on. Most times
I collaborate it goes on either a GBV album or a
Robert Pollard one, or under a pseudonym or something. I just did some backing vocals for J Mascis,
so that's his. I didn't really collaborate, though. I
just did what he told me to do.
One final question. I know you're a big
White Album fan. Why don't we do it in
the road?
Because no one would be watching us. And we
like people to watch us. •

It sucks when you really like a band, then you talk to them or interview them and
they end up being total jerks. I was a bit apprehensive when I was given the
opportunity to interview Jake Wherry, one half of the Herbaliser. Fortunately, Jake
ended up being one of the nicest guys ever. Musicians this talented with so little attitude are hard to find. We yibber-yabbered on the phone for awhile and I was very
happy he wasn't a jerk.
DiSCORDER: With this new album that you have out, you are working with more MCs than you did on Blow Your Headphones. Other
than What?What? you now also have Bahamedia and the Dream
Warriors, etc. What made you decide to work with more people?
Jake: We always wanted to. In retrospect, looking at how our production style
has evolved, I think it's a good thing, that. I mean, we're just from a fairly white suburb of London, there's no rappers around ot all. We've always had a common love
for sorta funky music and hip-hop. Rather than not make any music, we decided to
go ahead and make instrumental, hip-hop inspired music. Being inspired by soundtracks and cinematic music as well, we're able to develop quite a deep, layered,
orchestrated, musical, instrumental style. Then we found ourselves working with rappers, like we knew Fabian and he was on ihe first album. Remedies. By the time we
did Blow Your Headphones, we got to know What?What? and we did another
track with Fabian and Big led. Then just before we finished Blow Your Headphones
I put the band together which is like reforming my old funk band, the Profiteers, and
we just stand. It was a real hit or miss thing but the band turned out to be really successful. We did a lot of tours and shows. For instance, we met the Dreom Warriors
last summer In Toronto at the Waterfront,
t was going to ask you how you got to work with the Dream
Warriors 'cause being from Canada everyone here knows them.
Well, we've known them since their singles came out 11 years ago or whenever it
is their stuff come out. We're nearly 30 so we've been around a while. We were
playing down there and they came down and just did a bit of guest rapping with
us when we played live ond we hooked up from there. If was through the Dream
Warriors I got Bahamedia's phone number. Roots Manuva has been with Ninja
Tune and Blaze, he's a really good underground London rapper. He'd been doing
work with Vadim ond Mabb Deep and Vadim's got his own label but he's also a
Ninja artist so [we] kinda hooked up with him through that. The more we travel, the
more people we meet. ____r      m
You said you put together the band from an old funk band you were
in. How did you hook up with Ollie? I     Bt
We're from the same area. We went to the same college. We were aware of each
olher, we had heard our names mentioned in different circles, [but] it was awhile
before we met up. By the time we had met up I had been playing guitar for twelve
years and I had given up and I had bought a bass and started making beats with
a sampler, also jamming with a drummer and o keyboard player. Ollie had had a
sampler for a couple years as well. We just had a common interest when we set out
and basically as soon as we hod a couple records out, Ollie was doing a lot of
DJing nround the world, and I thought I'd make the Herballser Into a larger project
as well. It's just gone very successfully.
Your sounds are pretty different. It's like you're coming from different sides. Ollie definitely seems to have more of a hip-hop kinda
That was the trumpet player in the band. I met him about four years ago. It's like a
smaller, songy kinda Herbaliser thing. It's quite retro. Like a funky, soul thing.
I read in another interview that you don't keep on top of what's new
and hip and all that kinda stuff. What inspires the Herbaliser to keep
changing, then?
Um, I don't think we do, i think we just get better at what we do. We're still inspired
by music that we were inspired by five years ago. It's quite a lot of mechanical
processes to go through in the music that we make 'cause it's 90% samples, so we
have to take records off, then EQ them into the sampler, then we chop them all up
into lots of pieces, spend a lot of time editing them, getting different things in tune
with other parts. That takes a long, long time. We're better at that and going through
those processes. [A very loud airplane landing is heard on Jake's end.]
What's that? Do you live by an air base? What the hell is that?
No, that's my studio. Train Track Studios. I've got a mainline railway just right next
to my studio.
Well, what is your studio like? Other than being by train tracks?
tt's nice and organic and warm. When I went on tour with the Ninja Tune Dj tour
last summer —- last May, actually -— I bought so many records that when I came
back 1 had to knock down a wall. I used to have two studios; I've now made il into
one big control room with lots of cables, a big mixing desk, speakers and lots of
records. And a massively fast Apple Mac. I love it. We made our first two albums
on o Mac Classic ][. Primitive. ________..
Okay. This is kind of a weird question. I never realized this but I was
told that British hip-hop was intimidated by American hip-hop, d_
you see that at all?
f wouldn't say we felt intimidated otherwise we wouldn't be doing it. I think peopt
have been aware [that] in the past Americans were very dismissive of British hi
hop. Whereas now hip-hop has become a whole global ... like a patchwork quilt.
(t's been in France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Canada and England. People in
Japan — there's big scenes everywhere. People are obviously influenced by
Ameucan stuff. In the last few years, it seems like mainstream in America has com-
pleiely lost its values and principles of ihe original hip-hop disciplines. It's taken the
underground acts, like the people from San Francisco or the Bay area and British
producers like Vadim and Mark B, the Creators and us to start challenging things.
We've been accepted in America now. We're selling records there. We're gonna
produce two tracks on the new Bahamedia album. And Rove, she's quite a famous
rapper from LA. She's in London and we're going to produce tracks on her new
album as well.
After this point, the
being shacked up, r
onversation degenerated to gossip about Ollie and T-Love
:ord stores in Vancouver, and where to buy pot. •

I Jwl raising one eyebrow at you to accentuate
l_V w I t/ie verbal, he is as playful as his music,
mbut way more laid-back. You should have seen him
mbounding around the network of metal stairs that
Mcrawl up the back of the Holiday Inn, eagerly
tstriking poses for Ann's lens. After speaking with
Whim for a while though, I began to glimpse the
Maggressive personality that roughs up records and
mbrings you the hardest hitting beats. So expert is
MMix Master Mike with his hands that his tactile
Mscratching seems to cut grooves not just in your
s but down your back, straight to your rump.
UDiSCORDER: Mix Master Mike, how was
■Victoria?
■Mix Master Mike: It was cool. Seemed like
(there are a lot of kids are out there, I saw a lot of
lb-boys and b-girls,  lotta DJs ... they're really
■ hungry [for the music]. When I walked out on
■stage I got a warm welcome. I was happy.
iHow   are   your   teeth?   Last   time   you
■played here you had to cancel due to
■abscessed teeth.
■Yeah, yeah, I had some major surgery done on
Jmy jaw, because I had some poison in my jaw
■as about to burst and kill me.
|Shit.
., like, life threatening.
■Really?
■Yeah, it was really serious. That's why I couldn't
out here.  I feel real bad that I couldn't
out here,  but I  had to take care of my
■thing.
Bit's a good thing you're not an MC. Do
■you ever dabble in rapping? Do you find
■that, being around so many rappers,
■you all of a sudden bust out with a
■rhyme?
-lot at all. There's always instrumental
h crazy music going on in my head, it's
a psychedelic instrumental vibe. Yeah.
■ if you could collaborate with anyone,
■living or dead, who would that be?
■ Sun Ra. And his whole orchestra.
■what other jazz players do you want to
■ hook up with?
lohn Coltrane, of course Miles Davis.
■Anyone living?
■ No, all my heroes are dead.
■what's the most frustrating thing about
■being a DJ?
(Finding the lost break you've never found before,
s beat records, and beat mining and digging
■through crates and trying to find the one you're
■ looking for, just really obscure breaks. You know
■ the title but it's just hard for you to find, you hav
d go to all these used record stores, and you'
>nstantly just searching for stuff. Sometimes it ge
■ frustrating, but I end up finding other things too.
Does being a DJ mean that you don't b
same problems as more visible, commercially
successful musicians? Can you go places and
just be 'Mike' and not have fans on your ass?
Well, I'm not having problems, but pretty much
everywhere people know me. In Japan they chase me
with their mixers and stuff like that. They want me to sign
their mixers and they chase me down the street. It's cool,
it hasn't become a problem yet, but I know how it can
become a problem, hanging out with Ad-Rock for eight
months.
Because he's the babe-est of the Beasties.
That's my boy. By the way, me and Ad-Rock are coming
out with   an   album.   We're  collaborating   on   an
instrumental record.
Are you experimenting with playing different
instruments?
Yeah, like drums, Moog organs.
So is that gonna be on the album?
\ Maybe.
Us it coming out on Grand Royal?
It'll be under whatever we make up.
k Do you think it has become necessary
^ to include live instruments in order to
k advance hip-hop, keep it from going
k stale? Or do you think that element
% has always been there, in hip-
k hop's jazz and funk roots?
s far as the advancement of
khip-hop?    Maybe.    It    sort    of
^branches   it   out,   widens   the
k creativity of the whole hip-hop
. Like me, I'm learning
k how to play stuff here and
ind I feel like it
send      hip-hop
|_into other directions.
mber     the
Razzmatazz album,
k by Guru.
Just
listening     *°^
that        alburn^
I   can   tell   that^
Guru thinks that^
he   invented   the^
fusion   of   hip-hopl
and jazz.
No,   I   don't  think   i
think   the   Beasties
They [the Beastie Boys]^
had an album out by the^
time  you   started   DJing.*
You   were   14
started, right?
Right.
Were   they   an   influence   on
you?
Yeah, huge.
So when they approached you to
play, did you wet yourself?
It wasn't that unreal 'cause, you know, I had my V
own crew, the Invisibl Skratch Picklz, and I'
doing shows with them, tours, so they recognized^
me and they knew what I was about. And wher
Adam Yauch wasn't home I would leave these
messages, like scratch messages, on his machine.
And one ended up on Hello Nasty.
Yeah, that was one of the actual ones. It just drove
him berserk. This was while I was working on Anti-
Theft Device. They called me up and they sent me
some plane tickets. Mike D. got on the line: 'What's
up Mike?' I was like, 'Yo, shit, fly me down, cool.'
So were you happy with Anti-Theft Device
and Surprize Package, with how they
turned out? Did they turn out the way they
sounded in your head?
Yeah, I think so. I just want to say that 'Three MCs
and One DJ' is the number one video in Japan right
I just saw it two days ago. It's fucking great.
Whose idea was it?
Uh, mine and Adam Yauch's.
Is that someone's actual basement?
That was our dungeon. That's our practice facility in
New York City, we call it the Dungeon.
Do you still live in San Francisco?
On the outskirts of San Francisco, yeah.
Do you think that hip-hop and turntablism
revived rock and roll? With all those shitty
bands coming out, like Limp Bizkit, all those
shitty top 40 bands that have jumped on the
l bandwagon of mixing hip-hop with rock
\ and roll ...
^k Actually, I hooked up with Tommy Lee. He's doing
'       solo album called Methods of Mayhem,
motter of fact I've been in the studio with him
k [for] like the past four months, just hanging
out, staying over at his house, working on

Frock, aka 'grunge'?
fYeah, I think that hip-hop has taken away from
ind roll, if anything. Just became more
r popular, more of a money making business than
/rock and roll music, you know?
There's been a lot of talk lately, saying 'Hiphop has come full circle.' Do you agree or
disagree?
I think it's more recycling itself, it's just changing
constantly, just finding its way back, coming forward
and finding its way back again, as time changes the
music changes with it. People think it's dying, rap is
dying.
Because of Jay-Z and Brandy & Monica and
that shit?
Yeah, and all the collaborations. It's just getting
watered down and stuff like that. I agree sometimes
with that, but there are some underground artists
keeping it real, alive. But that's why I have my music,
I want to bring back the raw element of hip-hop and
the basic backgrounds of just music, the music aspect.
That means getting it out of the hands of
white money ...

ANGELS OF LIGHT
New Mother
(Young God)
Wim van de Hulst's photos for
this CD depict dead earth and
lush, choking vegetation.
Michael Giro's musical arrangements likewise run from stark to
unthinkably baroque. When the
brain and voice behind Swans
decided to write a love song —
an album of love songs — for his
estranged and departed
Jarboe, he recruited a battalion
of players and more instruments
than can be listed. Nonetheless,
even the most thickly layered
songs seem quiet and lonely.
This is partly due to a country
aesthetic which brings to mind
the eerie deadness of certain
American folk art forms. I have
to laugh at myself for comparing
New Mother to Shaker cabinetry
or Mennonite quilting, but the
association sticks. Giro's work
has become startlingly introspective and graceful over the past
couple of years (anyone who
has heard the Body Lovers
will agree) — even his lyrics,
which are often embarrassingly
heavy-handed and Gothic, come
across as less blatant. The country atmosphere feels authentic
even when peppered with synthesizers, tabla, xylophone, and
dulcimer. Those acclimatised to
the oppressive darkness of
Giro's earlier visions may find
themselves dazzled by the relative brightness and potential of
these new songs.

BEDSPINS
Oral Exciter EP
This one totally came out of right
field — or should I say the right
coast? This extended player from
Halifax quartet, the Bedspins,
came out late last year and has
not received a lot of press anywhere in Canada, which is a
real pity.
Singer/songwriter/guitarist
Charles Dickinson has a real
knack for writing self-deprecat-
ingly trad prog-pop lyrics and
music which jets you back to the
when every schmoe with a guitar decided he/she would
release an album, and, for some
wacky reason, it seemed to work
both aesthetically and aurally.
The fine lead guitar work by
Chad Murphy — cousin of
famed Murphy Brothers, Chris
and Matt — adeptly leads this
short six-song (and one secret
ALBUMS • ZINES • RECORDED MEDIA
track) album through blues- and
country-tinged rock and pop and
a quirky surf instrumental called
"Strange Days Revisited."
The addition of Dawn
Hatfield's (of Johnny
Favourite Swing Orchestra
fame) baritone sax on "Here and
There" and "Hey Mama" makes
these tunes feel like a cross
between the music heard at the
blues pub our parents now
spend their weakends at and
early '80s art-rock jazziness.
The Bedspins is more or less
a studio band at this time, but I
am really looking forward to the
day leadman Dickinson decides
to yank the Bedspins out on a
tour. The band's cheesy enthusiasm is that infectious.

I have never reviewed spoken

Well, I had, but I thought that

The CD itself (it's a double,
by the way — 99.17 minutes of
deconstructionalist spoken word)
is perfectly packaged: the cover

black and white photo capturing
the malaise and disassociation
of humankind with its surroundings and the angst of being a
white male in North America.
Yeah, whatever.

DEERHOOF
Holdy Paws
(KRS/5RC)
Hey it's Blonde Redhead, but
more prog, and they sound pretty boring. Wait a minute ... this
band is called Deerhoof This
band puts out Olympia-styled art-
rock, complete with lyrics that
make no sense at all, high-
pitched vocals, some grainy guitar licks, and odd rhythms.
Unfortunately, I find that the
ideas within their songs don't fit
together properly or flow well at
all. They're too long for what
they are, and well, they don't do
anything for me. To put it bluntly,
Deerhoof sounds like they have
a good idea of what makes for
good songs in their genre, but
they don't meld together very
well as a band, and thus they
are not very nice to listen to on

FRANKLIN
franklin
(Tree)
Pennsylvania's Franklin play
decent post-punk with an obvious reggae/dub influence. This
band has been around for quite
a few years and it seems that
time has definitely had an effect
on their sound. Originally a very
screamy and energetic band
with more of a punk side to
them, Franklin has gone for more
of the long jam-out oriented type
of songs on this effort. This is not
a far cry from June of 44's last
two albums, but Franklin's take
involves less artsy noise and
more lyrics. The thing I've
always liked about Franklin is
their distinct vocal harmonies,
ond on a number of tracks on
this album they show off their
voices, particularly in the super-
catchy "Major Taylor," which
combines an excellent dub
bassline with some good lyrics
and an inventive vocal harmony.
The album as a whole doesn't
really keep my attention the
entire way through, but every
song does have its moment. If
you haven't heard this Franklin
yet and are into dub-influenced
indie-rock, this might be worthwhile listening.

on two discs (or four pieces of
vinyl) provide a definitive look at
Gang Starr's previous five studio

great groups, this is a great
album Don't let my redundant
tone spoil that fact. Despite the
fact that lame-os like K-Ci & Jo-
Jo appear on the album (while
way cool "family members" like
Bahamadia do not) Guru's
love of jazz and conscious lyrics
make up for it the entire time His
thoughtful, multi-leveled
approaches and responses to
"bitches" ond "gangslas" provide the proof that some newcomers claiming to be conscious,
like Canibus, are full of shit and
still sucking on their mamas' tits
Speaking of child-rearing,
Guru's frequent references to his
son turn me on big-time Not
'cause I'm trying to make an
incestuous Oreo cookie with me

is something infinitely wonderful

THE GO
Whatcha Doin'
(Sub Pop)
Stupid rockers Silly boys. How
long is the attention span of
today's youth that they expect us
to still be interested in bands
rehashing the old lock sounds? I
like The Go alright, but I don't
really know if they're anything
So they rubbed me the
wrong way right off the bat by
recording their first song so that
it sounds poorly mastered and
about a million years old. Arg. If
I wanted that sound, I'd listen to
crackly old Kinks records. The
fact that they are so openly ripping off everything good is no
surprise, it's just weird to see
them do it so ... precisely. Once
the sound quality improves, this
CD is a lot easier to enjoy. The
lyrics are trashy and the guitars
are thrashy — you can dance to
your heart's content. This record,
unfortunately, doesn't have any
special qualities that make it
stand out from the current
onslaught of rock revival specialists. It is good, but not great.
No legends being made here,
only stolen from.

Listening to this single makes

to their brains. Not in a bad

weirdly-fun/odd things about
these people. Definitely some
lack of oxygen in the brain cavity. But in a really good way.
Miranda July provides the
vocals while IQU breaks up
some funky shit. Good, odd electronica. The vocals tell the story
of Ms. Sting (pronounced
"Staves") who has witnessed the
bizarre death of Mr. Mosel. The
victim then proceeds to ask the
young Ms. Sting (that's "Staves")
on a date despite the fact he
cannot speak. ("Oh, I get it,
you're building a language, how
cute.") If you are don't understand this review, be thankful.
Get the CD. You still won't get it
I don't think I do.
That's not to denigrate IQU.
No, it's a good thing to make
music and audio art that push
the boundaries of established
modes and tastes. IQU succeeds And they're not just some
crazy folks who smoke too
much, they make some excellent
music. The remix of this single is
beautifully relaxing.
Get this piece of music, if
only to play to your straight-edge
friends to prove how wacky you
truly are.

It's no joke: Stephin Merritt has

sary or over-the-top
Even these few excessive
tunes will be welcomed by most
Magnetic Fields fans, who
seem to be willing to take anything that Merritt dishes up and
cuddle it to death. Why? Merritt
is the man with the golden
tongue and the clever sense of
sound, and he knows how to
write a good pop song His use
of  wacky   keyboards,   banjo,
song, either
If you're a Magnetic Fields
fan, you probably already own
this — people were fighting over
the few copies of the box set that
Merge made available If you're
new to the world of Mag Fields,
start with disc one and collect all
three. You'll all have Merritt's
painfully catchy lyrics embedded
in your heads in mere seconds,
and you'll be much better off for
it.

22 October 99 knack for playing indie rock that
flows really nicely. Their music
portrays a sense of urgency without resorting to (often unnecessary) screaming, cheesy
power-chord choruses, or overly
earnest lyrics. This is what I
would venture to call rock that is
quite polished, definitely tasteful,
and somewhat guitar heavy, but
still very easy for almost anyone
to listen to. Good stuff!

(Negative   Air   Research)
Paul Molyneux and Simon
Smerdon pretend to be Ocosi.
Meanwhile, Mick Harris mails
in his drum bits and gets to be
the invisible English master
behind an otherwise Canadian
dark rhythmic release I like Mick
Harris. I never listened to
Napalm Death and there
were a couple of tedious Scorn
CDs, but he's done so much
wicked death ambient and
played with so many cool people that I have to plug anything
with his name on it. [IN] isn't the
greatest thing I've ever heard but
it has potential. "Yous" sounds
like one of those unpleasantly
dull Scorn tracks — six minutes
of a single, unvarying drum
beat. Fortunately, "Comascene",
"Bwoing", and "Suck Radius"
are all fine examples of rhythmic
sombience. It doesn't stand up to
half of Harris' original work, but
such is life.

RED HOUSE PAINTERS
Retrospective
(4AD)
Before y'all rush out to get this
new  Red  House  Painters
record, you should probably
know that it's one of those
"greatest hits and other miscellaneous scraps" albums.
Retrospective is a double CD
representing the band's 4AD
years. The songs on disc one
were selected by 4AD from their
own releases, while those on the
second disc — demos, live
tracks, and out-takes — were
selected by the band's Mark
Kozelek.
I suppose disc two is meant
to be a privileged peek into
Kozelek's own personal shoebox
of warbly cassettes and long forgotten master tapes, but I'm
more interested in listening to
disc one's more familiar album
tracks, whose highlights include
the charismatic Kiss cover,
"Shock Me", and hypnotic epics
like "Drop" and "San
Geronimo."
In small doses, the songs are
thoroughly engaging and
Kozelek's voice is, to quote the
liner notes, a "natural wonder."
But listen to Retrospective's entire
two and a half hours at once
and the 1980s style production
(chorusy guitars, overused
delays and reverbs) becomes
aggravating, the songs don't
capture the listener like they normally would, and Kozelek's
beautifully dreamy voice seems
dreary and monotonous.
Retrospective's first disc is
an adequate summary of the
Red House Painters' 4AD discography but I find disc two more or
less a throwaway. The live and
demo versions of album cuts
generally differ surprisingly little
from the released tracks. If the
outtakes were really that great,
they probably would have found
their way on to an album by
Wow, I guess I'm sounding
a little harsh in my critique I really do love the Red House
Painters; I'm just more interested
in their future than their past. I'd
much rather hear some fresh
material than assorted leftovers.
If you care to check out
Retrospective, be sure to listen in
moderation.

RHYTHM ACTIVISM
Jesus Was Gay
(G-7 Welcoming
Committee)
Jesus Was Gay is (if you buy
into the liner notes) at least the
37th release from Montreal poetry/music collective Rhythm
Activism. Founded by Sylvain
Cote and Norman Nawrocki in
1985, these cats specialize in
politics, humour, drinking, playing those rubber band things
you put in your mouth, and just
generally causing a scene. The
music is a kind of folky, circussy,
gypsy-like chaos with a lot of fiddle and very little bona fide
singing, so you may want to listen to this one before committing
to a purchase. If, however, you
can get into the leftist anarchy
and good-times humour of the
lyrics, oil else will slip away into
irrelevance and you'll be begging to support the movement.
Besides, at $1 1 through the
mail, you can hardly afford not

ROAD RAGE
Nothin' to Declare
(Radical)
Being a Martin myself, I must
give this band points for writing
a song with lyrics like, "You
know he's coming round your
place/ And he'll be coming in
your face/ Old Martin what a
cool guy" as Road Rage does
in the song "Smarmy Martin" off
their first full-length release
Nofhin' To Declare. This album,
originally released in Europe by
Bomb Factory Records, has been
re-issued by the American
oil/ska/punk label Radical
Records (home to Blanks 77,
Social Scare, Inspector 7,
etc.).
Road Rage describe themselves as "'77 style English
punk" — a description I'd agree
with — but the sped-up tempo
and grade school sing-song choruses that surface on certain
songs are rather more characteristic of a band signed to Fat.
This record is certainly well done
and easy to sing along or wave
your fist to, bar the questionable
lyrics on track 3 ("What's Your
Gender"). However, it does not
necessarily stand out from other
fast-paced, drinking, fighting,
obnoxious English punk bands.
If the Exploited were to force
themselves upon the Toy Dolls
(who from the union would have
a baby which spent a lot of time
in the orphanage with Snuff)
you would have Road Rage.

SQUAREPUSHER
Maximum Priest EP
(Nothing/Warp)
And in this corner, Tom Jenkin:
(aka Squarepusher) starts
with the most slow, melodic,
echoing track I've ever heard
from him. Sounding like a cross
between Pole (without the bass)
and a funeral oration, the heavy-
handed marching of the song
lines up mourners in black at the
death of the nation's favourite
android. The echoing sounds are
apparent in the title — "Our
Underwater Torch" — and then
move on into the more familiar
d'n'b of "Decathlon Oxide " A
somber, pallid mist is cast over
all of these tracks. Death mood
Underwater death, being suffocated by strong-armed scuba
divers. Piono chords and humming, rotating washes drift in
and out of a morphing, sometimes junglish, sometimes
Autechre-cold analogue-ish
d'n'b/breaks drum patch that
sucks the listener down beneath
the subterranean depths of the
deepest ocean canyons. At the
bottom, you discover a demented lounge-party featuring all
your relatives in '70s polyester,
as apparent in the loungey-slow
odd quirkiness of "You're Going
Down," a song which comes
complete with utterly fucked Mr.
Bungle-styled bass guitar and
vocals. "Cranium Oxide" sounds
like a torture session with a car
battery, while the AE mix of
"Two Bass Hit" continues on in
the same off-key underwater
glockenspiel-beat fashion, and
the Yee-King mix of "Circular
Flexing" ends up winning as the
standout track, working the same
underwater sounds, pushing
them to the background of the
eerie complex intelli-d'n'b which
becomes rife with squelches of
the glow-in-the-dark-deep-sea-fish
kind. Sharks unite!

HERBALISER
Thursday, August 26 and
Saturday, August 28
Sonar/The Rev, Edmonton
I like the Herbaliser a whole
lot. Everything they've ever
recorded, I dig This was my
heodspace as I headed out to
Sonar to see Jake and Ollie
and their eight-piece band. Of
course so did the entire population of Vancouver Admittedly,
when a show is disgustingly
packed, I don't have as much
fun It's hard to see what's
going on, it's hard to dance
and everyone is all slimy with
sweat Some people, however
think seeing live performances
like this is more fun, not me
(even though I did get elbowed
by one of the "stars" of Breaker
High]. Anyway, my grumpy self
edged my way up to where I
could see the Herbaliser busting out Instantly I knew why
they were the hit of the
Montreal International Jazz
Festival: a percussionist was
going crazy, the horn players
were great, Jake was hiding in
the background and Ollie was
behind the decks.
Unfortunately, from where I was
thing Ollie was doing, no samples floated my way The
Herbaliser was tight and it was
exciting to hear "Mother" and
"Ginger Jumps the Fence" performed by a full band. They
played a short set thanks to jet-
lag and Roots Manuva s
cancellation, so the night
ended early.
Then, two nights later, I
was lucky enough to see the
Herbaliser in good ol' E-town
(that's Edmonton, not a druggy
haze of ecstasy). The venue
was smaller, the city houses
fewer hipsters, and I was able
to comfortably watch the band.
I could even see and hear
Ollie, definitely my favourite
member of the Herbaliser. They
were just as tight and played
the exact same set but, because
I was in a better mood, I loved
them a bazillion times more.
They made me wanna dance,
not scowl. Another cool thing
about the Herbaliser is that
even if you don't like what
they're playing, they're such
talented musicians that they're
awesome to watch anyway.
Viva the Herbaliser!

into their performance on the
account of my inability to see
the stage and the constant chatter of clearly unimpressed pan-
sies sitting all around me, but
they still warrant further investigation. Just a note to all you
local bands: when opening up
a multiple band show, insulting
the audience for their lethargy
is neither an intelligent observation nor a good way to whip
up cowd support.

With my brand
to the Core 7" safely packed
away in my bag, I was ready
for the main event, but let me
tell you, I was in no way envying the Smugglers' position
following Pansy Division. It was
going to be difficult, but
Vancouver's own seemed ready
to rock. Rock they did but, alas
and alack, the crowd wasn't
with them. Maybe too many
people left before their set, or
maybe their aging fan base just
was, or maybe their most enthusiastic supporter had such a
small penis he felt the need to
push unsuspecting frontliners
onto the stage until there were
no more people on the front-
lines. Whatever the excuse, the
vibe died. Their encore went
Although tens of thousands of
miles away, Glasgow and its
musical ambassadors have
developed a very large (albeit
self-consciously composed)
Vancouver following. Belle
and Sebastian, Looper,
and bis are just some of the
celebrated Scottish acts to have
filled the Starfish Room within
the last year. And following in
the musical foot-steps of such
other bands as Slint and
Eleventh Dream Day are
now Mogwai and Ganger.
These two bands are lending
new credence to a very old
Saturday Night Live quote ("If
it's not Scottish ..."), and a full
house on a Wednesday night
testified to that fact. Only once
"Ganger? I
Cudahy, who
hawked CDs and
"Blur are shite" t-
shirts between drum
sessions, and presumably drove the
tour bus to and from
the gig.
After a short change of
sets, Mogwai appeared
onstage and eased into "BMX."
Looking much like the first portly cuts of a church league
rugby squad, Dominic, John,
Stuart and Martin were content
to lounge unemotionally about
the stage. Martin banged the
skins in the shadow of an amp
stack, and John played much of
the show seated with his back
to the crowd. But Mogwai's
music betrayed their apparent
detachment; songs like "Stanley
Kubrick," "Ex-cowboy,"
"Cody," and "Helicon 2"
soared in spite of it all, and "X-
mas Steps" gave new meaning
to crescendo rock. Sadly, much
of the audience seemed bored
by Mogwai's slower bits, and
the floor was more conversation area than viewing area —
which made me wonder, "Why
pay good money to see
Mogwai if all you're gonna do
is blab?" Sure, Mogwai may
not have the stage theatrics of
Van Halen or the Jesus
Lizard, but they do play some
pretty rod tunes worthy of
everyone's attention. At least
nobody was sitting in front like
preschoolers at a puppet show
(how lame is that indie trend?).
Mogwai finished the show with
"Mogwai Fear Satan" and a
final, ear-popping assault of
guitars that damn near tore the
heads off of the first few rows
of audience members There
was no encore and virtually no
demand for one The second
star of the night was guitarist
John Cummings who had
injured his hand in Seattle on
Tuesday (twelve stitches!), and
yet played on.

CIBO MATTO
RADIO
Saturday, September 4
Starfish Room
Radio .    one  word:   agony.
You're not cute or funny. People
already   wrote   "Fishheads,"
"Da    Da    Da"    and    "Planet
Claire," so give it the fuck up.
By   the   way,   stop   singing ..
please.
At this point in the rather
long day I wanted stupid fun or
a nap, and besides a few good
basslines or keyboard bits I
was getting neither. The ability
to disguise your intelligence as
a rump-shaking good time is far
more difficult than it is to show
artistic maturation, or so it
seems. However, a fit of inspiration struck Cibo Matto in
the fifteen or so minutes prior to
exiting the stage and all was
right with the world. Even the
misguided good heartedness
which brought the openers
back on stage to provide
vocals didn't wipe away my
smile. Encores are ludicrous as
a rule and it was time for that
nap, so maybe you can ask
one of the less discerning members of the packed house how
that went. . surely not as well
as the real end of the set.
