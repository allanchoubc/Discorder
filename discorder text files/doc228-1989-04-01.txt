Confusion & Weirdness Rule
Howdy Kids!
I just got here a month ago, and have made some
major drug-induced realisations about my neighbourhood. Myself & my roommate managed to splash
down in Kits, tongues flailing, eyes all agog, standing
on our hind legs to smell the air for meaningful
employment, food, fun, women & jugs of wine.
Everyone told us, "Yeah, man, Kits is the most
man, just the place to be in the summer man, gotta go
dude, yeah," so like mindless dogs, HERE WE ARE.
Now that I've been here, & given it a chance
to,...you know...grow on me, I am sad to admit, that
myself & my friend have been evilly duped.
Kits is full of brain-dead, sapsucking, image-
paranoid, cheesy YUPPIE mutants, and by God if I
haven't counted at least 100 people talking to the
atmosphere, gnawing their arms off, kicking at imaginary dogs, swapping snot, or just plain acting a wee
bit doughy.
I've also noted an abundance of tiny tots, bundles
of joy, decked out like a bunch of fucking Indonesian
tour-buses—They're kids for Christ's sake, they still
Uke to shit their pants & barf in unison & make poop
collages. Bleeding Yuppie pinheads are tarting those
wee buggers up in $300 outfits that get shat in, barfed
on, & act as sponges for Mrs Poopledoo's Exotic $4
a Bottle 100% Natural Processed Carrot Drool.
As if they expect onlookers to think "My what
well-garbed status symbols that couple has."
I mean, am I not cool or hip? Am I out of it?
Missing some kind of cosmic message? Or does
anyone know what I'm saying. I don't know anyone
in this city, I'm gonna gnaw my fucking arms
off...Arghh.
The weirdness is consuming me.
LONG UVE:
1. Bacon puffs
2. Pizza chips
3. Sugar

5. Big gas-sucking muscle cars
6. Loud raunchy motorbikes
7. Exposed armpits
8. Idiotic U.S. TV
9. 2 AM noise complaints
10. Shredded bits of clothing
& baseball caps.
Thankyou, thankyou very much

Confused in Kits
You Are Not Alone
Dear Sedro Wooley II,
Thankyou. Thankyou. Thankyou for the article
on 8-track cartridges. I was feeling lonely thinking I
was the only 8-track enthusiast and technological
scavenger left.
8-tracks are cool. 8-tracks are great. My friends
laugh at me because I have about a hundred tapes, and
a high-quality SONY 8-track recorder I picked up for
$46 a few years ago. But I know better.
In addition to the myriad benefits outlined in
last month's article, I wish to add that 8-tracks are also
valid creative tools. By taking out the metallic sensing tape (which causes the programs to switch), you
have a compact tape loop. In fact you have 4 distinct
tape loops (2 for quad) on each cartridge. 8-tracks arc
also fairly simple to splice backwards. And my very
first 8-track recorder even allowed me to record while
the machine was locked in fast forward. Playback at
normal speed is absolutely mind-blowing.
Also, if the tape does break when switching
programs, pry the box open with a screwdriver and
splice the tape together again. Sometimes you have lo
replace the metallic sensing tape but old reliable
Radio Shack (who else?) sells that loo!
Sometimes when I'm feehng really weird, I
hook up my dBx noise reduction unit to the 8-track.
Who needs CD's when you have dBx 8-tracks?
And here's another example of 8-track cost-
effectiveness. I once bought Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music for 25 cents, laughing all the while at a
friend who had paid 15 bucks for a used LP version.
Sorry, Duncan, but even I enjoy feehng smug.
One cautionary note though. We 8-trackers
should keep this format a secret. This deal is too good
to share. Keep the faith.
Frank Koustrup
Yes, We Try
Dear Airhead,
Okay, I got some gripes!
First, let me say that I'm sick of dumb shithpads
sending you "intelligent" criticism: lay off you halfwits—maybe Discorder ain't The New York Times
but at least they try. As the last bastion of true
"alternative"press (NiteMoves and the Straight don't
count and you know it!) holding back the non-culture
mass of yuppies/preps/eurofucks that seems to have
obliterated almost all of Vancouver's "alt" scene,
they get my vote as the most coolest. (Mind you, local
band coverage could be better I hope.)
Second. Okay, I know a lot of people are going
to rag out on me for this, but in response to D. Robinson's gloomy letter: I'm really sorry but I've just
about had enough of crusader/environmentalists. It's
the same thing as 1985/86's Ethiopia fixation and our
more recent apartheid obsession: The media fixates
and suddenly everyone is so concerned! Let's all get
a grip shall we? Sure it sucks but so does the fact that
your nose is too long or your dick is too short—that's
life, and anyone who goes toe to toe with rock-hard
reality for too long just 'cause it doesn't fit your ideal
is bound to be one sad fuck. You think injustice is new
to the planet? You're standing over the graves of
forgotten martyrs!
Anyway, have a nice day and thanx for printing
this,
YinYang G.L.
Oh Yeah! Uke What?
My Dear Airhead,
I can't sleep, Uhhh.... is "Yo. Yo. (ma)
Muhthuhfuhcken" music the best you can do? I've
heard more AlternativemusicinSave-On-Foods!..Get
Real.(?)
Sincerely,
J.W. Bacon & Eggs
P.S. How does "The Mater Pater Clog Hop
District" strike you as, umm, a, er, possible name for
the Endowment name-the-park project?
4    DISCORDER Political corruption, environmental concerns, quantum physics, serial killers, the great depression.
Comics have come of age. Traditionally, there are two formats for comics - the comic book and the comic
strip. The strip has always been affiliated with newspapers, targetting both children and adult audiences.
Comic books were created by sleazy businessmen with little interest in the creative potential of the
format. In addition, since the fifties, comics have been sold down the river to the McCarthy-types who
had faced the establishment of the Comics Code. Which is one of the reasons comics have been treated
as kids stuff in America, while regarded as a genuine story form in other countries. There's something that
should have been patently obvious from the beginning. The comic is a story form, not a genre, not a single
little business with a single little audience. What has happened over the past few years is that a new
fraternity of artists and writers have emerged, exploding the myths of comics as a children's medium,
challenging the congested incestuous business comics have been since the fifties.
Writers like Alan Moore, Frank Miller, and Bill Sienkiewicz have pushed the boundaries of comics
to the point of creating an exciting new literary format. Comics are geared towards our information-
overload society. In a twenty-minute sitting, comics can convey more information than a novel, and also
offer a more flexible medium than film. Comics can follow you anywhere and be re-read over and over
again. With a comic, you can stare at the page as long as you want and check back to see if this line
of dialogue echoes something four pages earlier. Alan Moore's Watchman practically re-invented comics,
repeating symbols that become laden with meaning. You can almost play them like music.
There are many titles available now that are well worth checking out. Brought to Light is a graphic
docu-drama chronicling thirty years of drug smuggling, arms deals, and covert operations that robbed
America and betrayed the Constitution. Aargh! which stands for Artists Against Rampant Government
Homophobia is a collection of works by artists in support of ADS victims. Helblazer offers an Aleister
Crowley-type hero in search of the balance between good and evil (demon yuppie soul brokers from
hell). There is the now classic Dark Knight series casting Bat Man as a cross between a nightstalker and
Dirty Harry. V for Vendetta, a claustrophic story of one man's battle against a fascist British government.
Reid Flemings World's Toughest Milkman, possibly the most obnoxious anti-hero ever, created written
and drawn by local hero David Boswell. There are many more titles worth checking out, including Killing Joke, Moonshadow, Blood, Swamp Thing, Marshall Law, and the truly brilliant, absolutely mind-
fucking Stray Toasters.
For all of you fools who consume The Province instead of a decent newspaper because the tabloid format is easier to read on the bus, a comic is even more managable and probably more relevant to
your existence on this planet. The Comic Renaissance is in your face.

Tom Waits Double Bill
DOWN BY LAW
VANCOUVER EAST CINEMA
7th AVE. & COMMERCIAL DRIVE 253-5455 Last month brought to Vancouver a little
of the old, a little of the new and a little
of the old reformed to appear new.
To begin, then, with the young'uns. Actually, it is very difficult to tell that Ninth Configuration has only been together for two years
based on their performance at Club Soda on
March 2nd. This amalgamation of diverse Calgary musicians forms a tightly knit hardcore
band whose stage show compares well to that of
SNFU. Lead singer Ben Hanscome's presence
reinforces the whole band's intensity that is
apparent both on stage and on their newly released ten-song demo. Songs such as Walkaway
and Die for You show off the band's musical
ability but do not lack any of the aggressiveness
found on more thrashy songs such as Party Girl
and Dylan's Blowin' in the Wind. Opening for
Ni-Con was another Calgary band, Tractorhead,
who were playing only their second ever gig.
Like Ninth Configuration, Tractorhead are a
refreshing change from the typical metal influenced groups emerging today. They have variation, good rhythms and a full-bodied sound that
holds together at high speeds.
Ni-Con stuck around to play Club Soda's
Metal Monday night as an opening act. Result:
Jon's $1300 amp stolen. Request: the bastard
who did it cram it up his nose sideways.
S aturday, February 25 th saw NoMeansNo,
backed by Earthling and Ni-Con, play their
first all-ages show in Vancouver in over a year.
The boys from Victoria put out one of the
funkiest, tightest brands of hardcore around.
Earthling, featuring two ex-members of The
Enigmas, were mildly entertaining as they
churned out their own 70's style of straight
ahead rock 'n' roll. NoMeansNo, however,
brought fans out of The Paramount's woodwork
and onto the floor to be awed by Rob Wright's
god-like bass work, Andy Kerr's erratic vocals
and energetic guitar, and John Wright's precision drumming. They held a young crowd by the
scruff of the neck through the long but intense
new lp's title track, Small Parts Isolated and
Destroyed, and teased them with short spurts of
blinding hardcore before setting them down to
regular slamming with the familiar Dead Souis.
On Sunday, the band was kind enough to dedicate a song to all of us here at CiTR - Self Pity.
Go figure.
For those who missed Ni-Con on their west
coast swing, and there were many as both Club
Soda and The Paramount were empty, you may
catch them at an all-ages show at The Lux
Theatre on April 1st with SNFU, Desperate
Minds and Curious George.
The Sunday night Club Soda shows
continued to impress as Stickdog came
to town on March 5th. The night's
theme was variety. Shindig competitors Silent
Gathering began the evening with songs that
ranged from mysterious and eerie to fast and
driving. Evident throughout was a great deal of
skill and control. At first, San Fransisco based
Stickdog resembled just another noise band with
an array of instruments including hammers,
steel plates, sheet metal and a tenor saxophone.
But this was not the case. A strange intensity was
created as two percussionists banged away on
drums and metal, an acoustic guitar was
strummed ominously and the singer howled like
he had one serious problem. Very industrial, but
at the same time more musical than most bands
of this type.

cassettes lately. While they 've been getting carted
and put on air at a pretty good rate, I'm just
hoping to make a dent in the pile with this
month's reviews. And for bands wanting to send
stuff in, remember to send your (not returnable,
unfortunately) cassette to CiTR and/or Discorder, attention one of the three of us, and eventually you should end up getting some airplay. Just
dropping in at the station and handing a tape to
the first person you see can be a very bad idea -
cassettes do have a way of going missing.
UPANGYBOTTOMS - Sixties Smile
Edmonton's self-called "premiere band of
goofs" kind of put me off the with the biggest
press kit anyone's ever given me, full of stories
about the boys "digging Cheese, Chicks and
Beer" and various underwear-related recreations. Yeah, yeah, so they opened for the Hoodoo Gurus when they passed through this part

music here, it's poppy, but the ■
conscious and uninteresting. Sixties Smile? What
is this supposed to mean, anyway?
DAYBREAK PARADE - Everybody Here
I have to admit the band's name made me
immediately think of groups like Catherine
Wheel. Well, you know the decade I'm talking
about, but Daybreak Parade surprised me by
sounding influenced by something a little later,
perhaps that genre of early to mid 70*s "sensitive" type stuff. It could just be the production,
but the vocals seemed a bit thin and wobbly. Not
that this tape is bad or anything, but isn't this the
kind of music that ultimately made people need
punk rock? (Oh yes, and the celebrity of the band
is Steve Forsyth, who runs the Railway Club).
CRAZY   FINGERS   -  Juice   Blues/Soup
Kitchen
It seems mean to say anything negative
about a band that's just broken up, and I think
that this is Crazy Fingers' goodbye demo, but I
't help it. To me, this feels a little sloppy, a
f ttle off. I kept waiting for the song(s) to get into
\ groove, but it never quite happened - of course
'm sure it can be argued that that's the idea, or
I'd justjjnoke a joint and then give the tape a
isten Still, the transition between songs re-
" me of that music when they turn down
the lights at the Planetarium. Sorry.
AGAINST THE GRAIN - Remote Control
The song starts off a little repetitive but
with a solid beat, then, bang, the singer comes in.
The question is, how dedicated is she to this
song? She seems more interested in showing off
her abilities {okay, admittedly impressive) as a
performer in the balls-y female vocalist style
than anything else. Or maybe the band needs to
do something to keep up?
BRIDE OF ZAMFIR - Backhand
Another female vocalist. This song starts
out with mostly bass and this quiet little girl
voice barely discernible underneath. But then,
all of a sudden, she yells and there's lots of noise
and I 'm reminded (of all things) of Penelope and
the Avengers. Too bad I can't make out a word.
This is sort of like a nasty, deranged Voice of the A couple of promising bands forced an 86
St. appearance that turned out to be worth it.
Both The Picasso Set and Oversoul Seven are
two fairly pop-oriented bands that are each distinctive in their own way. The Picasso Set have
a 60's garage sound with a distinct British influence. They arc self-described as "cubist pop-
groovies" and a "way fab pop combo daddy-o".
Oversoul Seven is a band with an almost certain
future in the music world. They are a guitar-
based three piece whose music is sometimes
tight and sharp, and at other times slow and
melodic. Presently on a cross-Canada tour, the
band has released a new album and have just
produced their second video. And this i
beginning.
Two more hands from California were at
Club Soda (again) on March 12th: Chemical
Peopleand AM. All are the rebirth of the Dependents, with a new lead singer. They are not a
bunch of old guys clinging to a name in order to
make one last grab for some cash. Not All, no,
not at all (sorry). Although they played the
Descendents songs Coolidge and Clean Sheets,
the band maintained the energy level of a group
just beginning its career. And after ten years, the
members all live together and admit that it feels
like they're just getting started again.
Chemical People could have headlined
another night with their basic but brilliant
hardcore. No metal, no gimmicks, no oddities
and no additives or preservatives. They have an
album called Tenfold Hate that should be available the first week of April. Pick it up.
The weekend of the 17th and 18th was
filled up by two triple-bills headlined by The
Scramblers and D.O.A., respectively.
Beehive. Fun, I think, as is one of the other songs
of the tape, Biker Chick, where the vocals
overload all the recording equipment in true
early punk style and you can just make out the
words "I don't wanna be a biker chick no more
no more no more". Well, amen to those sentiments and what a cool song.
POONA! POONA! POONA! - Chocolate
Wine
PPP does a really good job on their tape
covers - this one is a collage (an original too). As
for the song, it's intended, I suppose, to sound
like a pop band from the dead making an appearance on Scooby Doo, and it succeeds. (I don't
mean that as an insult, really I don't.)
One tape worth buying is the Theft of
Paradisecassette, wluchcontains work
by Jeanette Armstrong (an Okanagan
Indian, writer and activist), Rhythm Activism,
The Rhythm Pigs, and the ever-cool and politically dead-on NoMeansNo, among others.
Anyway, the tape's intent is to give a "Black,
White and Indian perspective" on Europe's
colonisation of North America. It can be had for
$5 from Technawbe Sounds, 720 Carson Rd.,
Ottawa, Ontario, K1K 0H3.
I'm always a bit nervous about writing
The Scramblers' card was filled out by
Slack,from Portland, and the all woman
locals, She. The praises continue for
The Scramblers whose shows are consistently
packed with dedicated fans who anticipate the
eventual take-off of the band's career. The first
impression one has of The Scramblers is of
Death Sentence without the show-off altitude.
The lasting impression is one of a bunch of guys
who love to play loud, heavy rock. Slack, on the
other hand, is a world beat Roots Roundup-
type group. Six members and instrumentation
that includes sax, trombone and bongos combined to produce a mixture of reggae, ska and
i?.z.
The D.O.A. and VERY special guest Jello
Biafra show on Saturday March 18th went
down as one of my top five concerts of all time.
Loudmouth rockers D.O.A. were extraordinarily good, playing many old favorites like-Class
War, The Prisoner and Race Riot.
Then, IT happened. Jello exploded onto
stage to sing the two songs he and D.O.A. perform during a party scene in the presently shooting movie, Terminal City Ricochet. He jerked
his body around me stage and belted out lyrics in
his distinctively whiney voice like a man possessed, resting only after throwing himself into
the awestruck crowd inorder to show his dislike
of "worship from afar". Chants of "D-O-A" and
"Jel-lo" filled the Sub Ballroom and succeeded
in bringing D.O.A. out for two encores.
What a combination: D.O.A. and Jello
Biafra. Who says dreams can't come true?
Gavin Brown
Warren Whyte
about bands that have CiTR members in them,
especially friends, and maybe that's the real
reason I haven't mentioned Picasso Set until
now, even though I like them. Their demo,
Somebody Girl and Kitten With a Whip, has
been quite a success on our charts, (and I believe, CJIV's too), and not because their bass
player, Pat Carroll, is a long time station member, but (I think) because the songs are that all-
too-rare combination of poppy and fun. Somebody Girl is my personal fave, and also comes
off like a hit single during their live set. I love the
keyboard line and the lyrics are so-oo innocent.
I'm not so crazy about Kitten With a Whip,
which relies a lot on the gimmick of cool name
dropping, but this is hardly relevant now that the
boys will be giving us a new demo soon, more
expensively produced and complete with female backing vocalists. I've heard criticism
about PS's name, unpolished stage show and
patter, and not earth-shakingly original sound,
but I like Picasso Set and Dave's vocals (strikingly like Tom Verlaine, the singer from Television) charm me to no end. As long as this band
retains its sense of fun and youthful outlook,
things should work out just fine for them.
And go see © (this time they 're really playing) at the Town Pump on April 4. They're
great! Janis
